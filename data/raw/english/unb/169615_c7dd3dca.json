    "body": "This October marks the 76th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Bangladesh. The year 2025 is of great significance and far-reaching impact for China. Over the past five years, the Communist Party of China with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has exercised overall leadership and provided strong guidance, while the entire nation has united together and worked in solidarity to concentrate on its own tasks. Not only has China withstood immense pressure and overcome severe tests, but also achieved significant progress in economic and social development. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), China’s gross domestic product (GDP) has maintained an average annual growth rate of 5.5%, with the total reaching approximately US$19 trillion, while consistently contributing around 30% to world economic growth. China has become the most stable, reliable and positive force for global development. This year also marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. Chinese President Xi Jinping solemnly reaffirmed that “the Chinese people firmly stand on the right side of history and the progress of human civilization. We will remain committed to the path of peaceful development, and join hands with all peoples around the world in building a community with a shared future for humanity.” 80 years ago, with huge national sacrifice, the Chinese people made major contributions to save human civilization and safeguard world peace. Today, among the world’s major countries, China has the best track record with respect to peace and security. It created the miracle of eliminating absolute poverty, and has always been a force for global peace, stability and progress. The year 2025 is also a crucial year for the international community. It marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The world today is undergoing accelerated changes unseen in a century, with frequent regional turmoil, impeded economic development, gaps in rules and rule of law, and an intensifying deficit in governance. Humanity again has to choose between peace and war, dialogue and confrontation, win-win cooperation and zero-sum game. Upholding peace and development, safeguarding the U.N. Charter, and defending international fairness and justice are not only the urgent expectations of the international community, but also our shared responsibility. At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Tianjin Summit, President Xi Jinping put forward the Global Governance Initiative(GGI). The five core concepts of the GGI, namely, adhere to sovereign equality, abide by international law, practice multilateralism, advocate the people-centered approach, and focus on taking real actions, are in line with the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. The GGI complements the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative, injects stability and certainty into a turbulent world, and further contributes Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to improving global governance. China solemnly proclaimed to the world a few days ago that, as a responsible major developing country, China will not seek new special and differential treatment in current and future negotiations at the WTO. This move stands as a testament to China’s resolve to safeguard the multilateral trading system and advance relevant global initiatives, and is set to inject new impetus into optimizing the global economic governance system. The year 2025 carries exceptional importance for China-Bangladesh relations. It marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between our two countries, as well as the China-Bangladesh Year of People-to-People Exchanges. Looking back over the five-decade journey, China and Bangladesh have always been good neighbors, sincere friends, and reliable partners. This March, Hon’ble Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus chose China as the destination of his first bilateral visit. In Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Chief Adviser Professor Yunus. The two leaders provided strategic guidance for the long-term development of bilateral relations. High-level delegations of several major political parties have visited China respectively with great success. A consensus on advancing friendly cooperation between China and Bangladesh has been reached among political parties. Both sides have adhered to the principle of win-win cooperation and jointly advanced high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. China has remained Bangladesh’s largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years. Since last August, over 20 Chinese companies have signed investment agreements with Bangladeshi partners, with a total intended investment exceeding US$800 million. China has become the largest source of FDI in Bangladesh since the interim government took office. Both sides have adhered to mutual support. Together, we provided joint medical care for the victims of the July Movement and delivered urgent aid to children injured in the heartbreaking jet crash. Exchanges and cooperation in politics, economy, defense, culture, education, health, sports, media, and youth affairs have grown steadily closer. By the end of September, the number of personnel exchanges between China and Bangladesh had exceeded 200,000 this year, bringing our peoples ever closer together in friendship and mutual understanding. The spirit of sharing weal and woe together has always defined the essence of China-Bangladesh relations. China supports the interim government of Bangladesh in its governance and backs the efforts of Bangladesh to hold the general election smoothly and successfully and to pursue a development path that suits its national conditions. China and Bangladesh now stand at a new historical starting point. China remains ready to continue working hand in hand with Bangladesh in our modernization efforts, and to jointly write a new chapter in building a China-Bangladesh community with a shared future. May the friendship between China and Bangladesh grow even stronger! May our nations prosper hand in hand, and bring more well-being to our peoples!",

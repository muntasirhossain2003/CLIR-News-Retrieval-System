    "body": "The holiday season is a time for family and celebration, but it can also bring high expenses. From gifts to travel and groceries, costs can quickly add up, making budgeting essential, experts say. Shopping expert Trae Bodge stressed the importance of saving wherever possible to avoid carrying debt into the new year. Plan gifts early and shop smartKiersti Torok, known as Torok Coupon Hunter on social media, recommends planning gifts well in advance to take advantage of sales. She buys Christmas stocking treats right after Halloween and buys decorations on clearance after the holidays. “Waiting until a few days after Christmas, you can find items up to 75% off,” she said, often using these deals for birthdays later in the year. Compare prices and use online toolsBodge advises comparing prices across stores, using coupons, signing up for emails, and leveraging browser extensions like PayPal Honey and Rakuten. While AI tools can suggest gift ideas, she says they are less reliable for up-to-date discounts. If an item isn’t on sale, look for a coupon or wait for a better deal. Save on groceries with couponsFor those hosting holiday meals, using grocery coupons can significantly reduce costs. Torok recommends starting with one favorite store and using its app to get accustomed to couponing, then gradually comparing prices at other stores. Cash-back apps like Top Cash Back and Ibotta can further boost savings. Buy in bulk and stock upGrocery expert Alli Powell suggests purchasing bulk items during holiday sales and freezing them for later use. This approach helps maximize savings and is useful year-round. Be cautious with store credit cards and buy-now-pay-later dealsBodge warns that store credit cards and buy-now-pay-later offers are only wise if you can pay off balances promptly. Mismanaged, these options can lead to high interest charges and affect credit scores. Flexible travel plans save moneyTravel expert Kyle Potter recommends booking flights first to maintain flexibility with dates and accommodations. Setting flight alerts on Google Flights can help track price changes and secure the best deals. By planning ahead, comparing prices, using coupons, and remaining flexible, holiday spending can be managed without breaking the bank.",

    "body": "As artificial intelligence (AI) spreads globally, militant groups are experimenting with the technology, raising concerns among national security experts. Extremist organizations could use AI to recruit followers, produce realistic deepfakes, and refine cyberattacks. A recent post on a pro-Islamic State (IS) forum encouraged supporters to integrate AI into operations, highlighting its ease of use. IS, once a territorial force in Iraq and Syria and now a decentralized network, has long exploited social media for recruitment and propaganda. Experts warn AI allows even small, poorly resourced groups to amplify their influence. Pakistani forces kill 7 insurgents in raid on militant hideout in Balochistan Researchers say extremist groups have created AI-generated photos and videos depicting conflict scenarios to recruit members and spread disinformation. AI is also used to produce deepfake audio of leaders and translate messages rapidly into multiple languages. While sophisticated AI use remains “aspirational,” officials caution the risks are growing. Hackers are already using synthetic media for phishing and cyberattacks, and militant groups could potentially pursue AI-assisted chemical or biological weapons. U.S. lawmakers are calling for urgent measures, including better information sharing among AI developers and annual assessments of AI threats by extremist organizations.",

    "body": "As Korean films and television gain worldwide acclaim, a rising number of South Korean actors are setting their sights on Hollywood, encouraged by broader casting opportunities and fewer appearance-driven barriers than those often faced at home. Actor Amy Baik said her decision to look abroad followed a disheartening experience in South Korea, where her scenes were cut from a commercial not for her performance but because she did not fit local beauty standards. The incident prompted her to question her future in the domestic industry and explore international options. The global success of productions such as Parasite, Minari and Squid Game has increased demand for Korean performers in Western projects, while also fueling the growth of agencies and consultants that help actors navigate U.S. casting systems. Casting director Julia Kim said Hollywood is widely viewed as the ultimate career milestone, but many emerging Korean actors lack access to agents or industry networks. Pakistan to produce film on Lyari, cites Indian propaganda over Dhurandhar portrayal Agencies like Los Angeles-based Upstage Entertainment aim to bridge that gap. Its founders say Western producers are increasingly seeking roles written specifically for Korean characters, though stereotypes still persist. Actors also face practical challenges, from differences in audition formats and headshots to language, accent coaching and unfamiliar industry norms. Consultants stress that accents are not a disadvantage and encourage performers to retain their identity rather than adopt an artificial American style. Limited opportunities, market slowdowns and age restrictions in South Korea are also pushing actors overseas. Some report greater flexibility abroad, where age is less emphasized and casting focuses more on suitability than strict categories. Those who have made the leap say international work has brought creative freedom and more balanced working conditions, reinforcing their belief that Hollywood is becoming more open to diverse Korean talent.",

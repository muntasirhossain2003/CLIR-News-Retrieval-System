    "body": "As temperatures drop and daylight fades early, my mind turns to the firepit corner of my garden — a simple setup with eight colorful Adirondack chairs arranged around a stacked stone hearth. In the growing season, the space is framed by low-maintenance plants like button bush, hydrangeas, hosta, clumping Liriope, and coleus. Simplicity is key. What matters most is the feeling it evokes: comfort, serenity, and a place to unwind. Gardens serve as sanctuaries, offering a refuge to lower stress and catch our breath, and studies show that the types of plants aren’t crucial — just being in the space is restorative. A few easy steps can give yourself this gift of peace: a chair, some unfussy plants, and attention to small details. Year-round enjoyment is a bonus. Sights, sounds, and scentsConsider next year’s garden now. Tall native grasses sway with calming rhythm, fragrant flowers such as lilacs, jasmine, sweet peas, and old garden roses fill the air, and simple additions like a windchime or tabletop water bubbler can enhance tranquility. Even small spaces can work: tuck a chair under a shade tree, hang a basket, or line a balcony with potted annuals, then take a few minutes to breathe and be present. Wild entertainmentNature can provide entertainment too. A birdfeeder, birdbath, and pollinator-friendly plants offer lively distractions as birds splash and bees and butterflies flit from flower to flower. Create a habitDevelop a ritual that draws you to your sanctuary daily — an afternoon tea, reading mail, or journaling. For me, it’s morning walks in the garden with coffee and pruners, or sitting on the porch in crisp air. Later, I’ll plan next spring with seed catalogs and highlighter, and on mild winter evenings, I’ll gather around the firepit under a blanket. Simplicity is the secret — a small, thoughtful space can provide relaxation throughout the year.",

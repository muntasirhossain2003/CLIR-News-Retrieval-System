    "body": "Students at Islamic University staged a symbolic protest on the campus in Kushtia on Wednesday, calling for justice in the murder of Sajid Abdullah, a student of the Al-Quran and Islamic Studies department. Protesters carried a red shroud representing his body to dramatise their demand for accountability. The protest began around 1:00 pm in front of the university’s administrative building, where students laid a blood-stained shroud at the main gate, partially blocking the pathway with ropes. They also displayed banners reading, 'Running the administrative building while bearing responsibility for Sajid’s murder.' Red markings spelling 'corpse' and simulated blood stains were scattered around the shroud to dramatize their demand for justice. Students said the protest was meant to hold university authorities accountable. 'There is no excuse to evade responsibility. We will continue demanding justice for Sajid Abdullah until it is delivered,' they said. They added that if the administration fails to act, students will take it upon themselves to identify the perpetrators, vowing to maintain their movement until justice is ensured. Leaders and activists of Bangladesh Chhatra Dal, Chhatra Shibir, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, and the Islamic Student Movement were present on the occasion.",

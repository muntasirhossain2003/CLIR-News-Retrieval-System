    "body": "Manchester United and Bournemouth played out a spectacular 4-4 draw on Monday in one of the Premier League’s most exciting matches of the season. United, who dominated much of the first half, took an early lead in the 13th minute when Amad Diallo nodded in Diogo Dalot’s cross near the goal line. Bournemouth responded before halftime through Antoine Semenyo, only for Casemiro to restore United’s lead with a header from a Bruno Fernandes corner. The second half saw Bournemouth turn the game around in just six minutes. Evanilson scored after 37 seconds following a precise through ball from Marcus Tavernier, and Tavernier himself curled a left-foot shot past the United wall to put the visitors 3-2 ahead. United fought back with a superb Fernandes free kick in the 77th minute and a clinical finish from Matheus Cunha two minutes later, reclaiming a 4-3 lead. Yet Bournemouth staged another comeback when Eli Junior Kroupi curled in a late equalizer with six minutes remaining, securing a 4-4 draw. “Fans will definitely enjoy it, but for us on the pitch it was frustrating,” Tavernier said. “We started the first half slow but came back in the second to take an amazing position in the game.” The draw lifted Manchester United to sixth place in the league, while Bournemouth, winless in seven matches, sits 13th.",

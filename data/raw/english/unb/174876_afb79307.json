    "body": "A sparkling exhibition of royal jewels opened Wednesday in Paris, even as the city continues to absorb the shock of October’s audacious crown-jewel theft at the nearby Louvre Museum. The four-minute robbery emptied cases in the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery, forcing its closure and raising concerns about the security of France’s cultural treasures. Meanwhile, the “Dynastic Jewels” exhibit at the Hôtel de la Marine — itself the site of a famous 1792 crown-jewel theft — is displaying diamonds, tiaras, and other historic pieces that survived revolutions and exile. Spread across four galleries, the exhibition features over a hundred items from the Al Thani Collection, the Victoria and Albert Museum, King Charles III, Cartier, Chaumet, and French national collections. Highlights include the 57-carat Star of Golconda, Queen Victoria’s sapphire coronet and emerald tiara, Catherine the Great’s diamond dress ornaments, and a Cartier necklace crafted for an Indian ruler. Gen Z and Millennials turn to sustainable, home-grown alternatives While curators did not disclose security specifics, the Hôtel de la Marine was modernized with high-grade protections when it reopened in 2021. The Louvre, meanwhile, is upgrading surveillance and anti-intrusion systems after the theft, and none of the stolen items have been recovered. Curator Amin Jaffer said the exhibit demonstrates how gemstones and ceremonial objects historically reflected identity, power, and prestige. Yet some Parisians feel the timing is sensitive. “People are still upset about the Louvre incident, and now there’s another jewel display opening nearby. It feels too soon,” said Alexandre Benhamou, a gift shop manager. Despite the uneasy backdrop, curators hope visitors will appreciate the history, craftsmanship, and stories embedded in the treasures.",

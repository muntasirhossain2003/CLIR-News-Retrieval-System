    "body": "BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman has described himself as “half-Sylheti” while speaking at a discussion meeting on Great Victory Day at the City Pavilion in London. “Many of you here are not just from Sylhet, but from other districts as well. Yet most of you are Sylhetis,” he said. The BNP leader made the remarks while addressing a discussion organised by the London Chapter BNP at the City Pavilion, marking Great Victory Day early on Wednesday. He added with a smile, “But there are people from outside Sylhet too… whether from Sylhet or elsewhere… I am also half-Sylheti, so there’s no need to say more.” The audience responded with enthusiastic applause, and Tarique appeared visibly cheerful. Tough days ahead as conspiracies persist, warns Tarique Rahman Tarique, the eldest son of BNP founder Ziaur Rahman and Chairperson Khaleda Zia, was born on 20 November 1965 in Bogura. On 3 February 1994, Tarique Rahman married Dr Zubaida Rahman, the daughter of Rear Admiral Mahbub Ali Khan, former chief of the Bangladesh Navy, who hails from Sylhet.",

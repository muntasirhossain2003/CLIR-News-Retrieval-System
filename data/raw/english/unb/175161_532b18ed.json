    "title": "‘We’re not afraid’: Indigenous Colombians continue daily life under threat of volcano eruption",
    "body": "Life continues largely unchanged for Indigenous residents living near Colombia’s Puracé volcano, even as authorities warn that an eruption could occur in the coming days or weeks due to heightened seismic activity and rising ash emissions. For 65-year-old Oliverio Quira, a member of the Coconuco Indigenous community, tending cattle near the volcano remains part of daily life. Having grown up on its slopes, he says fear has no place in his relationship with the mountain, which he views as both familiar and protective. Since an alert was issued on Nov. 29, officials have prepared contingency plans, including a possible evacuation of about 800 people scattered around the volcano. Standing more than 4,600 meters high, Puracé is among Colombia’s active volcanoes, with dozens of eruptions recorded over centuries. Severe flooding in Washington state leads to emergency rescues and evacuations For the Coconuco people, the volcano holds deep spiritual meaning. Community leaders describe it as a guardian of their land, honored through rituals and offerings meant to show respect and balance with nature. Ash emissions are interpreted as messages urging care for the environment. While authorities work to arrange shelters, local leaders stress that evacuation plans must also address food, water and livestock protection. Many residents say leaving without secure livelihoods would pose its own risks, underscoring their determination to remain on ancestral land despite the uncertainty.",

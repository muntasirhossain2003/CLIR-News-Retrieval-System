    "body": "Actor Arjun Rampal has confirmed his engagement to longtime partner Gabriella Demetriades, six years after they began dating. The announcement came during a conversation on Rhea Chakraborty's podcast, when the topic of marriage arose unexpectedly. Gabriella spoke candidly about love and parenting, noting, “Love comes with conditions. With a child, it’s different.” Rampal added with humour, “I after her because she was hot. Then I realised there’s more to it than just that.” The engagement was confirmed when Gabriella remarked, “We are not married now, but who knows?” and Rampal immediately clarified, “We are engaged,” surprising the host. The couple, together since 2018, have two sons—Arik, born in 2019, and Arav, born in 2023. They have mostly kept their personal lives private, occasionally appearing publicly with their children. Gabriella, a South African model and designer, has previously discussed balancing her creative career with motherhood. Rampal was previously married to former supermodel Mehr Jesia. The couple, who married in 1998 and share two daughters, Mahikaa and Myra, announced their separation in 2018, finalising their divorce in 2019. Rampal has stated that they continue to co-parent amicably.",

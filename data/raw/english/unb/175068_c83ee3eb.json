    "body": "Dr. Farhina Ahmed, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, has called on the global community to take decisive, coordinated and adequately financed actions to address the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Emphasizing the need for predictable financing, she noted that climate-vulnerable countries cannot confront these challenges without sufficient resources and access to technology. She made these remarks while delivering Bangladesh’s National Statement at the Plenary of the 7th Session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-7), held on Thursday in Nairobi, Kenya. Md. Ziaul Haque, Additional Director General of the Department of Environment, attended the plenary as a member of the Bangladesh delegation. Highlighting the financial strain on developing nations, the Environment Secretary said, “In the absence of support, governments are forced to divert scarce funds from health, education and social protection towards disaster response, jeopardizing the future of generations to come.” She urged UNEA-7 to help mobilize resources through multilateral environmental agreements in a coherent and synergistic manner. Recalling the urgency of the global environmental emergency, she underscored the need for international solidarity and compassion. “Climate change is a daily reality for Bangladesh,” She said, noting that extreme heat, cyclones, floods, sea-level rise and riverbank erosion continue to displace millions and degrade vital ecosystems. Despite contributing less than 0.5% of global emissions, Bangladesh continues to demonstrate leadership. She highlighted the country’s enhanced NDC 3.0—submitted within the global deadline—which aims to generate 25% of electricity from renewable sources by 2035, five times higher than the current level. Bangladesh is also advancing implementation of its National Adaptation Plan (NAP 2023) and scaling up locally led adaptation efforts across vulnerable regions. Addressing biodiversity loss, Dr. Farhina described the immense pressure on natural resources in a densely populated nation of 180 million people. She outlined Bangladesh’s ongoing implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2026–30), the National Conservation Strategy, the Ramsar Strategic Plan (2026–30), Land Degradation Neutrality targets for 2030, and other national policies on environment, forests and biosafety. On pollution, she reaffirmed Bangladesh’s pioneering role as the first country to ban thin plastic bags. “Ambition works when it is backed by strong policy and public commitment,” she said. Bangladesh has since introduced separate regulations for solid waste, e-waste, medical waste, hazardous waste and ship-breaking waste management. The country has finalized Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) directives on plastic waste and restricted the production, import and use of selected single-use plastics. A comprehensive Chemical Waste Management Rules has also been drafted. She called on UNEA-7 to adopt an integrated lifecycle approach to chemicals and plastics, ensuring prevention, safer alternatives and circularity while protecting informal workers.",

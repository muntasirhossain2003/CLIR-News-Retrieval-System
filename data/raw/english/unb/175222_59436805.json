    "body": "From gingerbread and mulled wine to the scent of pine and fir, familiar aromas help define the holiday season. To recreate those festive moods, many people light candles, burn incense or use fireplaces at home. While these practices can add warmth and comfort, experts caution that moderation is key to protecting indoor air quality. All flames release chemicals and tiny particles that can irritate the airways or contribute to longer-term respiratory problems if exposure is high, health specialists say. Still, there’s no need to abandon seasonal traditions altogether, according to Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University’s medical school. “Clean air is fragrance free,” McCormack said, noting that enjoying holiday scents occasionally is fine, especially if they evoke nostalgia or comfort, as long as people take steps to limit pollution indoors. Indoor air quality often worsens during winter because people spend more time inside and keep windows closed. The American Lung Association says indoor air can become more polluted than outdoor air when contaminants are trapped without proper ventilation. Fireplaces, gas appliances, candles, cleaning products and air fresheners can all release pollutants, including fine particles and nitrogen dioxide. Experts share advice to reduce financial stress and curb holiday overspending Health risks depend on the source and duration of exposure, as well as individual sensitivity. Children, older adults and people with asthma or heart and lung conditions are especially vulnerable. Symptoms such as coughing, headaches, shortness of breath or sneezing may signal poor air quality, and experts advise ventilating rooms or stopping use of pollutant-producing products if irritation occurs. Simple steps can help reduce exposure, including opening windows when possible, using HEPA air purifiers, choosing products with fewer ingredients and running exhaust fans while cooking with gas stoves. Experts also recommend setting boundaries around indoor smoking. “Even small improvements in air quality can lead to real health benefits,” McCormack said.",

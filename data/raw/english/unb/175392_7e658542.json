    "body": "Prosecutors in Los Angeles have charged Nick Reiner with the murder of his parents, filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Reiner, two days after the couple were found dead in their home. District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the 32 year old faces two counts of first degree murder with a special circumstance alleging multiple murders. The charges also include an allegation that a knife was used in the killings. If convicted, Reiner could face life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. Prosecutors said no final decision has yet been made on whether they will seek capital punishment. Authorities said Rob and Michele Reiner were discovered with multiple stab wounds at their Brentwood residence. Autopsies are pending to determine the exact cause, manner and time of death. Reiner is expected to be brought before a court to formally hear the charges and enter a plea after he is medically cleared by prison officials. His arraignment has been postponed to a later date. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell described the case as deeply personal and heartbreaking for the family and the city, and offered condolences to those affected. Rob Reiner was known for directing widely acclaimed films including This Is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally and A Few Good Men. Michele Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of a photography and production company. Tributes have poured in from friends and colleagues in the film industry, who remembered the couple as dedicated partners in both their creative work and public life.",

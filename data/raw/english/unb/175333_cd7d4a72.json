    "body": "Bangladesh left-arm fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman became the most expensive Bangladeshi player in Indian Premier League (IPL) history on Tuesday after Kolkata Knight Riders secured his services for 9.20 crore rupees at the IPL auction. Mustafizur, who had a base price of 2 crore, attracted strong interest from multiple franchises, with Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders engaged in a bidding contest before Kolkata emerged victorious. The final price surpassed the previous record for a Bangladeshi player at the IPL auction, set in 2009 when Mashrafe Mortaza was signed by Kolkata for $600,000 — equivalent to roughly 5.45 crore at current exchange rates. The signing marks Mustafizur’s sixth IPL franchise. He previously represented Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Capitals and Chennai Super Kings. With Kolkata, he adds another chapter to a career that has made him one of the most sought-after overseas pace options in the league. Mustafizur made his IPL debut in 2016 with Sunrisers Hyderabad and played a key role in their title-winning campaign, taking 17 wickets in 16 matches, including a best of three for 21. Across eight IPL seasons, he has played 60 matches and taken 65 wickets, with a strike rate of 21.2 balls per wicket. He has registered six three-wicket hauls and nine instances of taking two wickets in a match. His most productive recent season came in 2016 with Hyderabad, where he claimed 17 wickets in 16 matches.",

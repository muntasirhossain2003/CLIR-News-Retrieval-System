    "body": "Sierra Leone has declared the end of an mpox outbreak in the country. The declaration on Tuesday aligns with international health standards, which require a minimum of 42 days without a new confirmed case, Health Minister Austin Demby told a ceremony marking the second anniversary of the National Public Health Agency (NPHA). All 16 districts with reported cases have exceeded the 42-day timeframe, with several areas surpassing 150 days since their last infection. Since the first mpox case was recorded on Jan. 9, Sierra Leone has reported 5,442 confirmed cases, including 60 deaths. Foday Sahr, executive director of the NPHA, said the agency's establishment symbolizes Sierra Leone's commitment to never again facing health emergencies unprepared. The ceremony drew commendations from global health leaders, including Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, and Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who praised Sierra Leone's efforts in effectively addressing public health threats.",

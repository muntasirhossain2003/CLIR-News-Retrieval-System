    "body": "Pakistani authorities have announced plans to produce a film titled Mera Lyari, citing what they described as Indian propaganda in the portrayal of Karachi’s Lyari area in the Bollywood film Dhurandhar. The Sindh Information Department said the upcoming film aims to present what it termed an accurate depiction of Lyari, contrasting with how the area was shown in Dhurandhar, which is set partly in Lyari between 1999 and 2009. The Indian film, released on December 5, depicts the area as being affected by gang violence, police operations, drug trafficking and militancy. Although Dhurandhar was not released in Pakistan, it has drawn attention there following its commercial success in India. The film was directed by Aditya Dhar and stars Ranveer Singh. In a post on X, the Sindh Information Department said Lyari represents “culture, peace and resilience” and rejected what it called attempts to portray the area through propaganda. It said Mera Lyari is scheduled for release in January 2026. Lyari, a densely populated neighborhood in Karachi, has historically been associated with gang-related violence, particularly during the early 2000s, a period depicted in Dhurandhar. The film includes characters based on real-life figures linked to criminal activity and law enforcement operations in the area. Officials said the new Pakistani film will focus on Lyari’s social and cultural identity. Further details about the cast and production have not been disclosed.",

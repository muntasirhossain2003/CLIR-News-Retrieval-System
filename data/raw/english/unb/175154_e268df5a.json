    "body": "Mohamed Salah marked his return to Liverpool action as the champions secured a 2-0 Premier League victory over Brighton on Saturday, completing the first phase of the Egyptian forward’s reintegration into the squad. Salah, who is set to leave for the Africa Cup of Nations, came on in the 26th minute to a warm reception from the Anfield crowd and provided the assist for Hugo Ekitike’s second goal. The win lifted Liverpool to sixth place and extended their unbeaten run to five matches in all competitions. ‘Monumental Betrayal’: FIFA slammed for latest World Cup ticket hikes Liverpool manager Arne Slot downplayed concerns about Salah’s future at the club, saying there was “no issue to resolve” following recent tensions. Salah had held talks with Slot on Friday after being left out of recent matches following public criticism last weekend. Arsenal, meanwhile, tightened their grip at the top of the table with a dramatic 2-1 win over bottom side Wolverhampton, though both goals came from Wolves’ defensive errors. After goalkeeper Sam Johnstone’s own-goal put Arsenal ahead, Tolu Arokodare equalised late on before Yerson Mosquera diverted Bukayo Saka’s cross into his own net in stoppage time. Chelsea also enjoyed a 2-0 home win over Everton, with Cole Palmer scoring his first goal in three months, while Fulham beat Burnley 3-2 to deepen the hosts’ relegation worries.",

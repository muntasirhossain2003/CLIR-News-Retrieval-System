    "body": "Ousmane Dembélé and Aitana Bonmatí were honored as the world’s best male and female players of 2025 at FIFA’s Best Awards on Tuesday, further cementing their dominance in a year that also saw both win the Ballon d’Or. Dembélé enjoyed a standout season with Paris Saint-Germain, playing a key role in the club’s maiden Champions League triumph, while Bonmatí impressed at both club and international level with Barcelona and Spain. The FIFA Best Awards are determined through votes cast by national team captains and coaches, journalists and fans worldwide. Coaching honors also went to two European champions. England manager Sarina Wiegman was recognized after guiding her team to a second consecutive Women’s European Championship title, defeating Spain in the final in Switzerland. On the men’s side, Luis Enrique was rewarded for leading PSG to Champions League glory along with domestic success in France. Notably, the winners of the four top awards mirrored the results of the Ballon d’Or ceremony held in Paris in September, underlining a consensus on the standout performers of the year. FIFA hosted the annual awards ceremony at a private dinner in Doha, timed around PSG’s appearance against Flamengo — the reigning South American champions — in Wednesday’s Intercontinental Cup match.",

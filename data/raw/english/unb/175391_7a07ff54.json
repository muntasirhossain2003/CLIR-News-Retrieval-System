    "body": "An Ibrahimovic could once again be celebrating silverware with AC Milan, but this time it may be Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s son, Maximilian. The Rossoneri have called up 19-year-old Maximilian Ibrahimovic for the Italian Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, with the young forward joining the senior squad amid a growing injury list. He is one of six players from Milan’s reserve team included in the traveling party. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, one of Milan’s most iconic players, scored 93 goals in 163 appearances across two spells at the club, winning two Serie A titles and the Italian Super Cup. While the former Sweden striker has not come out of retirement, his son could make his senior debut and potentially lift a trophy in the coming days. “They have good skills,” Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri said of the young call-ups. “I wanted to reward them for what they are doing in training.” Milan, the Italian Cup runner-up, faces Serie A champion Napoli in the Super Cup semifinal on Thursday. Italian Cup winner Bologna will meet Serie A runner-up Inter Milan in the other semifinal, with the final scheduled for Monday. Despite being held to a 2-2 draw by Sassuolo at the weekend, Milan sits second in Serie A, one point behind Inter and one ahead of Napoli. “Tomorrow is a different match, it’s a knockout game where the aim is to reach the final,” Allegri said. Milan won its eighth Italian Super Cup last season, defeating Inter in the final.",

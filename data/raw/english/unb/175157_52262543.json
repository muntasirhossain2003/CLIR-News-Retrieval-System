    "body": "The pressure to spend heavily on gifts, celebrations and travel during the holiday season can feel overwhelming, especially as many people face a tight job market, rising debt and persistently high prices. Financial therapist Lindsay Bryan-Podvin said those feeling stretched are far from alone, urging people to be more intentional about their spending and to remember that showing care for loved ones doesn’t always require money. She noted that expectations fueled by nostalgia and social pressure often make the holidays more stressful than joyful. What do you get when pumpkin pie collides with deep-dish pizza? Experts say creating a clear budget is a crucial first step. Jennifer Seitz of family finance app Greenlight advised accounting for all seasonal costs — including travel, shipping and tips — and setting limits to avoid starting the new year in debt. Regular debt payments should also be included to prevent falling behind. Shopping strategically can also help. Consumer expert Trae Bodge recommends seeking out sales, coupon codes, cash-back offers and browser extensions that automatically find discounts. Bryan-Podvin also encourages people to identify what matters most by listing holiday expenses and prioritizing meaningful activities over obligation-driven spending. Setting boundaries, including declining events or gift exchanges, can reduce emotional and financial strain. Finally, experts suggest creating low-cost traditions focused on shared experiences rather than purchases, which can often leave more lasting memories than expensive gifts.",

    "body": "Vice-chancellor of Gazipur Agricultural University Professor GKM Mustafizur Rahman at an event on Saturday said that soil was not merely a resource, it was a timeless refuge for our very existence. He made the remark at the GAU in Gazipur marking World Soil Day 2025, said a press release. Highlighting this year’s theme, healthy soil for healthy cities, he described urban soil as a silent life-force that sustained city living. ‘Yet one that is rapidly deteriorating under the pressures of unplanned urbanisation.’ Citing scientific findings, he noted, ‘Excessive concrete seals the ground, blocking air and water movement and ultimately destroying beneficial soil microbes, fungi and insects essential for natural soil fertility.’ Industrial heavy-metal pollution such as lead, cadmium and arsenic disrupts nutrient cycles and stunts root growth, the VC mentioned. Poor waste management and overuse of chemicals further increase soil acidity, diminish water-holding capacity and leave the soil hard and lifeless. Offering solutions, he emphasised permeable pavements and green roofs to restore moisture and microbial life, community composting to enrich organic matter and urban tree planting to improve biodiversity and soil stability. He also stressed the value of phytoremediation, using select plants to gradually remove contaminants. Professor Rahman called for seeing soil not just as farmland but as a living ecosystem at the root of urban sustainability. Noting that Gazipur Agricultural University continues to lead research, innovation and policy support for restoring urban soil health, he urged, ‘Let us treat soil not simply as a resource, but as a responsibility.’",

    "body": "A young man allegedly assaulted a priest of the Panchabati crematorium and temple in Rajshahi on Saturday. The victim, Sagar Kumar Roy, the priest, was attacked at about 12:00pm inside the temple complex. Ashok Saha, general secretary of Hindu Buddhist and Christian Welfare Front, said that Alif Ali had entered the temple complex and demanded some bamboos. As the priest refused, an argument ensued when the young man physically assaulted him, he alleged. Closed-circuit television camera footage showed the man entering the cremation area to collect bamboo used for funeral pyres. After the altercation, the man chased the priest, when he was leaving. The Boalia police officer-in-charge Rabiul Islam said at 4:30pm, ‘There has been a scuffle. But none has so far filed any complaints.’",

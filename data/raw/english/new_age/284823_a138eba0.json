    "body": "The government has approved a policy to upgrade the pay scale of 65,502 headteachers of government primary schools from the 11th grade to the 10th grade. According to a cabinet division notification issued on Wednesday, the decision follows a meeting held on December 3, during which the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education proposed the upgradation. The meeting was informed that, following a writ petition, the pay scale of 45 head teachers had already been upgraded from grade 11 to grade 10 through a government order. Building on that, the proposal to upgrade the remaining 65,502 head teacher posts was placed before the authorities concerned, and the Ministry of Public Administration gave its consent. Both the Ministry of Public Administration and the finance division have approved the proposal, with the finance division’s implementation wing formally fixing the pay scale at grade 10. The cabinet division noted that all conditions set by the relevant ministries must be fulfilled before implementation.",

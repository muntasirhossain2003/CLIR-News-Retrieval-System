    "body": "Lakshmipur district election office was set on fire on early Saturday, damaging part of the office and destroying several documents and equipment inside. Some masked people allegedly poured petrol into a ground-floor storeroom of the Lakshmipur District Election Office and set it alight around 3:30am, said the police and election officials. The incident occurred two days after chief election commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin had announced the schedule for the 13th Jatiya Sangsad Elections and the national referendum on the July charter on Thursday evening. Election officer Md Faruk Hossain said that the attacker broke or opened a window before starting the fire. ‘A night guard was asleep inside the office at the time but raised the alarm after noticing the incident, prompting the suspect to flee,’ he said. The early detection of the fire helped limit losses, Faruk said. Senior police officers visited the site and assured authorities that security around election offices would be tightened further, he added. Several voter registration documents from 2008 and 2009 were destroyed, along with an unused desktop computer and other equipment. Officials said that the fire was quickly brought under control, preventing extensive damage. An investigation was under way and efforts were being made to identify and arrest those responsible, said the police. Lakshmipur deputy commissioner SM Mehdi Hasan said that instructions were issued to strengthen security for election offices across the district.",

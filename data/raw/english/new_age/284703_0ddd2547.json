    "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party chair and former prime minister Khaleda Zia still remained in a critical condition. A senior BNP leader told New Age on Tuesday that nothing significant, positive or negative, had occurred in the past two days. Meanwhile, a source in the medical board treating Khaleda Zia said, ‘She is still not stable enough either to be taken abroad or operated upon.’ Khaleda was admitted to Evercare Hospital on November 23, and after examinations, doctors confirmed that she had developed a lung infection. On November 27, she was moved to the critical care unit, where she remained under the care of a medical team comprising doctors from the United States, the United Kingdom and Bangladesh. BNP chair’s personal physician and member of the medical board AZM Zahid Hossain on Saturday told reporters that the BNP chief’s transfer abroad for advanced medical treatment would be dictated by her physical condition in the future, as advised by the medical board. Initially, the BNP had scheduled Khaleda’s departure for London for December 5 on an air ambulance from Qatar. However, the aircraft failed to arrive due to technical issues, prompting the party to announce a revised plan for December 7. To facilitate the transfer, the Qatari authorities had arranged to hire a German air ambulance, party sources said. Zahid on Saturday said that the air ambulance was always on standby, but the highest priority remained ensuring Khaleda Zia’s proper treatment as well as her safety and security from a medical standpoint.",

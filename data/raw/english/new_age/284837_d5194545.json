    "body": "Fire service personnel were yet to rescue a minor boy who fell into a deep tube-well pipe at Tanore upazila in Rajshahi on Wednesday, despite hours of frantic attempts. The boy, identified as Sajid, 2, slipped into the abandoned deep-tube well pipe at village Aloknagar while following his mother, local people said. Didarul Alam, assistant director of the Rajshahi Fire Service and Civil Defence, said that a unit from Tanore reached the spot around 1:45pm, but the rescuers could not commence extraction without heavy equipment. ‘The pipe is extremely narrow and goes deep into the ground. Without a backhoe (Beku) or soil-cutting support, it is not possible to start a safe rescue operation,’ he said. Two more fire service units from Rajshahi city later joined the operation, and three backhoes were now being used to excavate the soil around the pipe. ‘We are continuing the rescue work with three units. The soil around the pipe is being carefully removed so we can widen the area and insert a rescue camera. It is a highly sensitive operation,’ Didarul Alam said. As of filing this report on Thursday morning, Sajid was yet to be rescued.",

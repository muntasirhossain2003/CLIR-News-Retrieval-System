    "body": "The police on Saturday sought public assistance in detecting a suspected shooter who was allegedly involved in the gun attack on Sharif Osman Hadi, an aspiring independent candidate for Dhaka-8 constituency in the upcoming national elections. Hadi, also the spokesperson of the Inquilab Mancha, was shot in the head from a close distance by unidentified assailants in the capital’s Bijoynagar area on Friday afternoon. Hadi is now undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital in a critical condition. The law enforcement agency said that police launched intensive operations across the city to arrest the attackers. ‘Police have analysed CCTV footage from the area and have been able to preliminarily identify a suspect captured in the footage,’ said a Dhaka Metropolitan Police press release. Efforts were underway to track down and arrest the attacker at the earliest, it said. The DMP has urged anyone with information about the suspect or his whereabouts to contact the DMP deputy commissioner for Motijheel division at 01320040080, or Paltan police station officer-in-charge at 01320040132, or the national emergency helpline 999. Police assured that the identity of the informer would be kept confidential and appropriate rewards would be given for authentic information. Meanwhile, DMP commissioner SM Sazzat Ali said that the police were working to detect the suspect. Responding journalists’ questions after the 42nd annual general meeting of the Retired Police Officers Welfare Association at Rajarbagh Police Lines, the commissioner said, ‘We are looking for the prime suspect. It has not been 24 hours yet. Hopefully, we will be able to detect his whereabouts soon.’",

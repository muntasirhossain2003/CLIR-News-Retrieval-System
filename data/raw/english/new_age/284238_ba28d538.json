    "body": "The special ambulance, being facilitated by the Emir of Qatar, will now arrive in Dhaka from Germany, instead of Qatar, to carry former prime minister and Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia to London for further treatment, if her health condition permits for travelling abroad. A spokesman at the embassy of Qatar in Dhaka confirmed this adjustment to UNB on Friday afternoon. ‘It will now come from Germany with support from Qatar.’ He, however, did not tell the time of its arrival in Dhaka, indicating that BNP will decide when they need the air ambulance. The air ambulance was initially expected to come from Qatar.",

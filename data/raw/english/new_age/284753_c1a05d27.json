    "body": "A constable of the Barishal Metropolitan Police has been accused of attacking Asian TV journalist Firoz Mostafa with a hammer at Firoz’s rented flat on Gora Chand Das Road in the city on Monday night. Firoz, Barishal bureau chief of Asian TV, was rescued after a 999 call and admitted to Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital. The accused, Navid Anjum, a constable of the Amanatganj police outpost, has been taken into custody. According to Firoz, he has known Navid for several years, but the constable’s involvement in drug use and online gambling led to disputes among them. He alleged that Navid tried to blackmail him with personal family photos and had been harassing him for months. ‘On October 25, he came to my flat with several people and assaulted me. From October 25 to November 2, they kept me confined. I finally called 999, and the police rescued me,’ he said. He claimed that the then Kotwali Model police station officer-in-charge Mizanur Rahman refused to record his complaint at that time. He later submitted a written complaint to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. He said that Navid threatened him again during a hearing on November 13. Kotwali Model police station officer-in-charge Al Mamun Ul Islam said that the police rescued the journalist based on a 999 call. ‘We will take action after receiving a complaint,’ he added. However, injured journalist Firoz said that he would file a case regarding the attack after recovering. Meanwhile, Barishal Reporters’ Unity and several other journalist organisations have condemned the attack and demanded a fair investigation and exemplary punishment of the perpetrator.",

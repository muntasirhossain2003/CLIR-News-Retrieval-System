    "body": "A delegation from the Danish veterinary and food administration has recently visited Bangladesh to reinforce long-standing cooperation in ensuring food safety in the country’s dairy value chain. The visit provided comprehensive insight into the entire dairy value chain, from livestock management to milk processing and preservation, said a press release issued by the Danish embassy in Dhaka on Sunday. The visit, organised by the Bangladesh Safe Food Authority, was part of ongoing collaboration between Denmark and Bangladesh, particularly with BSFA, Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution, Department of Livestock Services and the Directorate General of Drug Administration, aimed at strengthening food safety standards from production to consumption. The release said that the visit highlighted the importance of strategic sector cooperation between Denmark and Bangladesh in strengthening food safety governance, enhancing productivity, and combating antimicrobial resistance. In Tangail, the Danish delegation visited a milk chilling centre where fresh milk from local farmers was received, quality-tested and rapidly cooled every day to maintain safety and freshness. The team observed the maintenance of the cold chain and inspected equipment that dates back to Danish-supported development efforts of the 1970s, including an industrial Avery bulk milk weighing scale. The scale, originally built in England, later imported to Denmark and eventually donated to Bangladesh, has been in use for more than four decades and now stands as a symbol of the enduring partnership between the two countries in promoting food safety and agricultural development. Bangladesh and Denmark sides expressed commitment to further deepening cooperation to ensure a safer, more sustainable and efficient dairy sector in Bangladesh, contributing to improved public health, food security and economic resilience.",

According to the case statement, Russel and his wife had been involved in longstanding family disputes. Over these conflicts, Russel and several accomplices allegedly strangled Eti with a towel inside their home between November 23 and November 30. The accused later placed the body in a sack, tied four bricks to it and dumped it beneath water hyacinths in their pond on the eastern side of their house in an attempt to hide the crime. On the evening of November 30, locals noticed the sack floating in the pond and alerted Muksudpur police and the police recovered the body and took it to the station. After the incident, family members of the victim went to the police station. Later, Eti’s brother Md Selim, 37, filed a murder case accusing Russel and others.

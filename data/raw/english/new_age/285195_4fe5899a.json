    "body": "United Nations secretary-general António Guterres on Sunday called Bangladesh interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus to express his profound condolences over the tragic death of six Bangladeshi peacekeepers in a drone attack in Sudan. ‘I am calling to express my deep condolences. I am devastated,’ Guterres told Professor Yunus, adding that he was horrified by the attack. The UN chief expressed his solidarity with Bangladesh and requested the Chief Adviser to convey his condolences to the bereaved families, said the Chief Adviser’s Press Wing this evening. Professor Yunus said he was deeply saddened by the loss of the Bangladeshi peacekeepers and urged the UN to facilitate the evacuation of the injured soldiers to top medical facilities, as well as to ensure the swift repatriation of the bodies. Guterres informed the Chief Adviser that the injured peacekeepers were initially treated at a local hospital in Sudan and that arrangements were underway to transfer the seriously wounded to better-equipped hospitals. Professor Yunus thanked the UN chief for paying attention to the treatment and evacuation of Bangladeshi soldiers. During the phone call, which was made around 7:00 pm (BST), Professor Yunus also recalled UN Secretary-General's visit to Bangladesh during last Ramadan. The two leaders discussed the upcoming general elections, with Professor Yunus assuring Guterres that the interim government would hold a free, fair, peaceful, and festive election on February 12. Guterres expressed confidence that Bangladesh would successfully conduct the elections.",

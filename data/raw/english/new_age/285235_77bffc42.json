    "body": "The Rajshahi divisional administration on Sunday directed the eight deputy commissioners of the division to submit detailed information on the installed and unsealed deep tube wells amid growing concerns over public safety. In a letter issued by additional divisional commissioner (development and ICT) Rezaul Alam Sarker, the deputy commissioners were asked to provide the information by December 18. The directive came two days after a two-year-old boy died falling into an abandoned test bore near his home in Tanore upazila of Rajshahi on December 10. Local residents said that the bore was one of several test wells drilled last year by private operators in search of irrigation water. Most of the failed bores were left uncovered or loosely filled with soil and straw, they alleged. According to the letter, deep tube wells have been installed across the eight districts of the Rajshahi division by the Barind Multipurpose Development Authority, the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, and through local initiatives. It noted that in many cases the mouths of deep tube-well pipes were left open and unsecured, creating serious safety hazards and increasing the risk of fatal accidents. ‘In this context, to prevent accidents caused by exposed and hazardous deep tube well pipes, the district administrations of the eight districts under this division are specially requested to submit district-wise information in the prescribed format to this office by December 18,’ the letter said.",

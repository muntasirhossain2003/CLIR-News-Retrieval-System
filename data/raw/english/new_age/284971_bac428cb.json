    "body": "The Airport Armed Police Battalion on Friday arrested two individuals along with a large number of electronic spying equipment allegedly used for recruitment and admission test fraud from the outer area of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. A case has been filed against them under the Special Powers Act, 1974 (Sections 25B(1)(B)/25D) at the Airport police station, the police said. The detainees were identified as Shaharun Ali (38) and Md Iqbal Hossain Jibon (35). According to APBn, acting on a tip-off, a team detained the duo and recovered 76 digital spy devices, 50 earpieces, three laptops, and six mobile phones from their possession. During primary interrogation, Shaharun admitted that he brought the devices from China, posing as a regular passenger, and was preparing to leave the airport together with Iqbal, who was waiting outside as part of the racket. Investigators said the seized devices are commonly used for sophisticated cheating in recruitment and admission tests. The credit-card-shaped devices, tiny invisible earpieces, and transparent extraction threads help fraud syndicates communicate answers to candidates inside exam halls. The main device automatically receives incoming calls when connected to a SIM card and kept on the body, while the micro earpiece inserted deep inside the ear allows covert communication. After the test, candidates extract the earpiece using the transparent thread. APBn Operational Commander, Superintendent of Police Mohammad Mozammel Haque, said, ‘These devices are banned items and have previously been used for fraud in various exams. We are conducting regular operations to curb such illegal activities.’",

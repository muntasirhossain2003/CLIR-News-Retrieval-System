    "title": "Nat’ monument closed to visitors for 9 days ahead of Victory Day",
    "body": "The government authorities have shut the National Monument at Savar to the public for nine days to carry out extensive renovation and preparation work ahead of the Victory Day on December 16. A notice posted at the main gate on Sunday said that visitor access will remain suspended from December 6 to 15 ahead of the celebration. Memorial authorities said that the closure is required to ensure a safe environment for state ceremonies, cleaning operations and development work before the national observance. The people, who will place wreaths on the Victory Day at the national monument, were urged not to damage the beauty of memorial area. ‘We are carrying out necessary preparations to organise the state programme for Victory Day smoothly,’said Md Anwar Khan Anu, a public work department official who oversees the site, adding that this is why entry has been restricted for a limited period. He sought cooperation from the mass for the temporary inconvenience, and requested to keep the both sides of the road clean.",

    "body": "The Rapid Action Battalion has arrested a suspected mugger over killing an officer of the power division on the Tongi flyover in Gazipur. A team of CPC-2 under RAB-1 arrested Imran, 30, on Sunday, a day after Keraniganj power division office’s store officer Siddiqur Rahman was stabbed to death, allegedly by muggers, early Saturday. Addressing a press conference at RAB-1 office in Uttara on Sunday late night, its commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Ashikur Rahman said that the team conducted an operation in the Mazhar Slum and arrested Imran with a locally-made weapon. The team has also seized evidence including a sharp weapon used in the mugging. Victim Siddiqur’s son Nahid Rana filed the murder case against some unidentified people with Tongi East police station on Saturday night. The elite force analysed CCTV footage and the recovered evidence to identify the suspected killer. Ashikur mentioned that Imran intercepted Siddiqur for mugging on his way to the office in the morning and attempted to snatch Siddiqur’s money and mobile phone. Imran stabbed him three times in the left arm with a sharp weapon when he tried to resist. The mugger left the weapon and blood-stained shoes while fleeing the scene. After the incident, Imran went to Konabari in Gazipur and later that same day returned to the Mazhar Slum, where he hid. He sold the snatched mobile phone in the slum area for Tk 1,000, said Ashikur. Tongi East police station sub-inspector Mehedi Hasan on Monday morning told New Age that Imran was handed over to the police and further legal proceedings were underway.",

    "body": "A group of Dhaka University students on Tuesday staged a shoe-throwing programme at a photograph of late Jamaat-e-Islami amir Ghulam Azam, who had been jailed until death on charges of crimes against humanity committed during the War of Independence. The programme was held in front of the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union building in the afternoon marking Victory Day. During the programme, the students hurled shoes at Ghulam Azam’s photograph and chanted slogans against war criminals and collaborators of the Pakistani occupation forces. The students said that as part of their hatred and protest against razakars, they carried out the shoe-throwing programme. They also said that Victory Day was not only a day of celebration but also a day to register resistance against the forces who opposed the War of Independence.",

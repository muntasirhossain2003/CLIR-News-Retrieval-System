The injured, Md Rabbi, 21, son of Md Helal Mia, is a resident of Shahbazpur upazila. He currently lives in a rented house in Majhikara area of the municipality. Rabbi was initially taken to Nabinagar hospital and later referred to Cumilla Medical College Hospital for further treatment. Witness Md Billal Hossain said, ‘We were having tea at a roadside shop when we heard gunshots. We saw a tall young man running with a pistol in his hand, but no one could identify him. The injured, Rabbi, was immediately taken to Nabinagar hospital.’ The motive behind the shooting is yet to be determined. Local sources said that a dispute resolution meeting was taking place at Balurchor field near the Zamindar Bari in the municipality, in which Rabbi and his friends were present. On their way home after the meeting, Rabbi was shot at Kalibari Mor. Dr Onkon Roy of Nabinagar hospital said, ‘The young man has a gunshot wound on the left side of his chest.

    "body": "The Bangladesh interim government chief adviser, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has expressed deep concern over the shooting and serious injury of Sharif Osman Hadi - spokesperson of Inqilab Manch and probable independent candidate for Dhaka-8 constituency - by unidentified assailants in the capital’s Bijoynagar area, asking the authorities concerned to bring the perpetrators under the law soon. ‘Such a violent attack in an election environment is completely unacceptable and a deeply regrettable incident for the country’s peaceful political atmosphere,’ he said in a statement this afternoon. The chief adviser asked the authorities concerned to ensure the best possible medical treatment for Osman Hadi. He also directed the Ministry of Health to closely monitor the treatment process and provide necessary guidance. At the same time, the chief adviser gave strict instructions to the law-enforcement agencies to conduct a swift and comprehensive investigation to identify and bring all those involved in the attack to justice. He ordered immediate measures to collect evidence from the scene, gather information from eyewitnesses, review CCTV footage, and uncover whether there is any organised plans behind the incident. The chief adviser said, ‘No act of violence aimed at disrupting the election will be tolerated. It is our duty to ensure public safety and the free movement of candidates. Whoever the perpetrators are, they will be brought to justice.’ He called upon all political parties, activists, supporters and citizens to maintain peace and restraint so that the upcoming election can be held in a peaceful, participatory, and safe environment.",

    "body": "India’s Border Security Force pushed 15 more people, including two children and nine women, into Bangladesh through the Bibishan border point at Gomastapur upazila in Chapainawabganj district early Sunday. With the latest push-ins, the number of people, including Rohingyas and Indian nationals, pushed into Bangladesh by India since May 7 has increased to 2,417. The Indian border force has so far pushed at least 223 Rohingyas, including 50 registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in India, into Bangladesh. Nayek Subedar Abdul Mannan, commander of the Bibishan border outpost under the Border Guard Bangladesh-16 battalion, said that BGB personnel spotted the group during routine border patrols early in the morning and took them to the camp for preliminary interrogation. He said that initial questioning revealed that the detainees — two children, nine women and four men — were Bangladeshi nationals from Jashore, Narail, Khulna and Manikganj districts. ‘After confirming their identities, we handed them over to the Gomastapur police station,’ he added. Abdul Barik, officer-in-charge of the Gomastapur police station, said that the individuals were currently in police custody. ‘Further legal steps will be taken after consultation with higher authorities,’ he said.",

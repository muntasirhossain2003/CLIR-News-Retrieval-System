    "body": "The interim government-provided ‘Very Very Important Person’ privilege for ailing Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia would not cover the other members of her family, environment adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said on Thursday. Rizwana said this while briefing journalists at the Foreign Service Academy in Dhaka. The briefing was held after the council of advisers’ meeting at the chief adviser’s Tejgaon office. In response to questions, she also said that Khaleda would receive every facility entitled as per the law. The interim government on December 2 declared ailing three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia a VVIP. The decision was taken at a special meeting of the council of advisers at the state guest house Jamuna, with chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus in the chair. The decision was conveyed to Khaleda’s family and her party. Following the decision, the Special Security Force and the President’s Guard Regiment were deployed at Evercare Hospital from December 2 for the security of Khaleda under the security protocol. Khaleda has been undergoing treatment at the hospital since November 23, the day when she fell seriously ill.",

    "body": "Indian high commissioner Pranay Verma on Saturday said that India sought a stable, positive and mutually beneficial relationship with Bangladesh based on equality and mutual respect, in which the people of both nations remained the main stakeholders. He made the remark as the high commission of India celebrated the 54th anniversary of Maitri Dibas 2025 at the Indian Cultural Centre in Dhaka, marking India’s recognition of Bangladesh as an independent state on December 6, 1971. Verma termed Maitri Dibas a milestone in the history of the two neighbours, expressing confidence that both sides would continue working together to fulfil their people’s aspirations and advance cooperation inspired by shared sacrifices. The celebration featured a soulful cultural programme by Bangladeshi artistes, highlighting the cultural links between the two countries. Performances included theatre, dance choreography and musical presentations. The opening act, ‘71 in Silence’, directed by Ramesh Mayappan for Sundaram Productions, portrayed the story of Bangladesh’s birth through disability-inclusive physical storytelling. It was followed by a dance presentation by Srishti Cultural Centre under the direction of choreographer Anisul Islam Hero, showcasing Bangladesh’s vibrant heritage and the enduring friendship with India. The event concluded with an performance by the popular rock band Shironamhin. Freedom fighters, cultural activists, youth and distinguished personalities from across Bangladesh attended the programme.",

    "body": "The leaders of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami on Monday at a discussion vowed to build a corruption-free democratic country if they were voted to power in the elections slated for February 12 next year. Dhaka south city unit of the party organised the discussion meeting in the National Press Club auditorium to mark Victory Day where south city amir Nurul Islam Bulbul chaired. Amir of Jamaat Shafiqur Rahman called on the political parties to unite to build a corruption and discrimination free country implementing the spirit of July Uprising. ‘We would respect both ‘71 and the mass uprising of ‘24 and dishonor none and want to form an extortion and discrimination free democratic country,’ said the Jamaat leader. He, however, mentioned nothing about their anti-liberation role during the War of Independence in 1971. He called on the political parties to remain united for implementing the spirit of July Uprising and said the implementation of the July spirit would be the best way to resist the fascists in the country. Condemning the attack on Sharif Osman Hadi, a July Uprising organiser, Shafiqur Rahman said that the attack was carried out to kill him. He requested journalists to publish fully what they say but not to twist comments, which became embracing for the party. Assistant secretary generals of the party ATM Masum and Rafiqul Islam Khan and others spoke in the programme, none mentioned anything about anti-liberation roles of their leaders during the Liberation War.",

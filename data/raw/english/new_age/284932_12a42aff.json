    "body": "A section of officials and employees of the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited have threatened to stop metro rail services from today if their demand for the formulation and publishing independent service rules is not met. The officials and employees under the banner of ‘DMTCL permanent officers-employees recruited through direct open recruitment’ had given the authorities concerned December 9 as the deadline to accept their demand. The DMTCL in a press release issued on Thursday night, however, said that the services would run as usual today. Earlier, about 700 DMTCL employees from Grade-10 to Grade-20 observed an all-out work abstention between August 6 to August 19, demanding an end to what they said injustice and discrimination in their jobs and upgradation of their pay scales. A press release issued by the employees on Thursday night said that the interim government’s adviser to the road transport and bridges ministry, Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, gave a directive to the DMTCL to formulate independent service rules on September 12, 2024. It further said that the rules had not been formed yet and due to lack of the rules, a few hundred officials and employees had already left the company. The services of the country’s first-ever 20.1-kilometre electricity-powered elevated and air-conditioned rail system on the Uttara-Motijheel route had been inaugurated in phases since December 28, 2022.",

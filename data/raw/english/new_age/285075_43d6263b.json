On Saturday morning, he met with Jamaat-e-Islami amir Shafiqur Rahman at the party’s central office and completed the formalities by filling out the preliminary membership form. During the meeting, Akhtaruzzaman expressed deep confidence and satisfaction with Jamaat-e-Islami’s principles, ideology, patriotism, and steadfast stance on safeguarding the country’s independence and sovereignty. He pledged to dedicate the remainder of his life to upholding Islamic values, national interests, and the nation’s independence and sovereignty. He also vowed to remain loyal to the party’s rules, discipline, and organisational principles. Shafiqur Rahman warmly welcomed him and wished him a long and prosperous life. The event was attended by the party’s secretary general and former MP Mia Golam Parwar, as well as assistant secretary general Maulana Abdul Halim. Major (retd) Akhtaruzzaman was expelled from BNP on February 20, 2022, for allegedly engaging in activities against party discipline.

After independence, he remained active in politics and social welfare initiatives. He served the Bangladesh Army before retiring as a major and was elected twice to the national parliament from Kishoreganj-2 as a BNP candidate.",

    "body": "Education adviser CR Abrar has said that proficiency in artificial intelligence was then essential in the library profession. ‘AI will not replace librarians—rather, those who cannot use AI will be the ones replaced. Learning AI is now mandatory for librarians,’ he said. He was speaking as the chief guest at the international conference titled ‘Re-imagining librarianship: Forging the future with AI technologies’ held on Friday at the Nabab Nawab Ali Chowdhury Senate Building of Dhaka University. The conference discussions focused on four major themes: the role of AI in modern libraries and information services, emerging opportunities, challenges, and future preparedness. The adviser said artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming modern education and the information service sector, and it is essential for librarians to take the lead in this transformation. ‘Artificial intelligence is not merely a technological development—it is the next chapter in the evolution of human knowledge. If librarians do not become partners in this transformation, they risk losing their role as gatekeepers of knowledge,’ he added. Researchers from various countries, including a former president of the American Library Association, attended the event.",

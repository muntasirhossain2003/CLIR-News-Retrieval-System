    "body": "The High Court in a judgment on Thursday, directed the authorities concerned to digitise the entire process of marriage and divorce registration in the country. A High Court Division bench of Justice Fahmida Quader and Justice Md Ashif Hasan pronounced the judgment after holding hearing on a writ petition filed in this connection. ‘The court’s decision would serve as a historic step toward ensuring family security, women’s protection, prevention of child marriage, legal transparency, and-most importantly-curbing fraud related to marriage and divorce,’ Ishrat Hasan, who moved the plea before the court, told reporters. She said that once digital registration is introduced, issues such as secret marriages, concealment of multiple marriages, withholding previous information, and difficulties in proving divorce would significantly reduce. ‘This would strengthen citizens’ social dignity, promote justice, and help rebuild mutual trust within society,’ she added. On March 4, 2021, Supreme Court lawyer Ishrat Hasan filed the writ petition on behalf of four victims.",

    "body": "The Border Guard Bangladesh has detained two Indian cattle smugglers along with a Bangladeshi accomplice during an operation at Manaksha border under Shibganj in Chapainawabganj. Acting on secret information, a patrol team from Masudpur BOP under the Chapainawabganj Battalion conducted a raid in Thuthapara area under Manaksha union on Friday night, BGB officials said. The operation led to the arrest of Indian nationals Abdul Qadir, 30, and Delwar Hossain ,34, both residents of Par Baidyanathpur village under Baishnabpur police station in Malda district, India, and Bangladeshi national Md Maruf ,17, son of Shafiqul Islam from Tarapur village in Shibganj. According to BGB sources, the two Indian smugglers entered Bangladesh around 4:00am on December 3 through the barbed-wire-free Fatehpur border with four cows, which they handed over to local smuggler Md Fazel. Increased BGB patrols in the area prevented their return to India, forcing them to hide in the remote Padma River char on December 4. With help from their local associate Maruf, they later took shelter in Thuthapara, where BGB personnel apprehended them. The detainees have since been handed over to Shibganj police station for legal proceedings. Commenting on the operation, Lieutenant Colonel Kazi Mustafizur Rahman, Commander of the 53 BGB Battalion, said, ‘BGB is always playing a vigilant and alert role to ensure border security and suppress any kind of illegal infiltration and smuggling.’",

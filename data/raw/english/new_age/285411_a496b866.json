    "body": "Singapore’s foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, informed Bangladesh interim government chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus on Wednesday night that the condition of Sharif Osman Hadi was extremely critical. Balakrishnan called Professor Muhammad Yunus to update him on Hadi’s medical condition at 9:40pm, says a press release of CA press wing. The chief advisor urged the nation to remain calm and requested prayers and support for Hadi’s recovery. Critically injured Sharif Osman Hadi, the convener of Inquilab Mancha, was on Monday flown to Singapore from Dhaka in an air ambulance for advanced medical treatment. On December 12 afternoon, Hadi was shot in the head in the Box Culvert area of Bijoynagar while he was conducting his electioneering, a day after the Election Commission announced the schedule for the 13th Jatiya Sangsad elections and the national referendum on February 12, 2026. Physicians said that Hadi was seriously injured as a bullet pierced his head above the right ear, causing significant brain damage. CCTV footage showed that Hadi was heading towards Bijoynagar on an auto-rickshaw when the two men wearing helmets on a motorcycle opened fire on him on the Box Culvert road before fleeing the scene. The law enforcers arrested ten individuals in connection with the attempted murder.",

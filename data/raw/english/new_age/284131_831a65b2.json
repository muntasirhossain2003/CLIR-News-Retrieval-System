    "body": "The Bangladesh Nationalist Party has announced the names of candidates for 36 more constituencies for the Jatiya Sangsad elections slated for the first half of February 2026. The list was unveiled on Thursday afternoon at a press conference held at the BNP chairperson’s office at Gulshan in the capital Dhaka. Earlier, on November 3, the party had released its first-phase candidate list for 237 constituencies. The following day, the BNP suspended the nomination for the Madaripur-1 constituency amid controversy. With Thursday’s announcement, the BNP has published its candidate list for a total of 272 constituencies. The remaining 28 constituencies would be announced in due course, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said. ‘We are announcing candidates for 36 more constituencies, while 28 will remain pending. Decisions regarding alliances and a few other constituencies for the BNP will be made later,’ he said. The BNP has nominated its executive committee member Sheikh Robiul Alam to contest the Dhaka-10 parliamentary seat. Other contender for the seat was BNP chairperson’s international relations committee member Nasir Uddin Ahmed Asim. Moreover, there was a speculation that the interim government adviser, Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuiyan, could contest the seat if an agreement was reached with the BNP. Economist Reza Kibria, who recently joined the BNP, has been nominated to contest the Habiganj-1 (Nabiganj-Bahubal) parliamentary seat. Reza Kibria is the son of former finance minister the late Shah AMS Kibria.",

    "body": "The High Court on Monday rejected a writ petition that sought to stay all activities related to the next Jatiya Sangsad elections, slated to be held between February 8 and 15, 2026. A bench of Justice Sikder Mahmudur Razi and Justice Raziuddin Ahmed passed the order after petitioner and lawyer Earul Islam, appearing in person, said that he would not press on the writ petition. The bench told the lawyer was ‘lucky’ that the court had even examined the merit of the plea. In the morning session, the court warned of ‘serious consequences’ after Earul sought an urgent hearing. Deputy attorney general Mehedi Hasan requested that the matter be heard today as the top item. But in the afternoon, Earul returned and requested the court to remove the petition from the day’s list. The court instead directed him to treat it as not pressed. Speaking to New Age, Earul said that he would not pursue the matter further in any court. Earul’s petition argued that the executive branch was exercising powers assigned to the Election Commission under the constitution. He cited Article 126, which requires all executive authorities to assist the commission, but said that deputy commissioners effectively acted as returning officers, while election officials remained idle. He also referred to Article 118(4), which states that the Election Commission shall be independent in performing its functions, and Article 119(1), which vests the authority of superintendence, direction, and control of the elections in the commission. Earul Islam had claimed that these powers were being exercised by the executive branch instead of the Election Commission.",

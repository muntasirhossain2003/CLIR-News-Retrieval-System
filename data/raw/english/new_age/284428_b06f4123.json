    "body": "Industries adviser Adilur Rahman Khan on Saturday said that the country’s sugar industry could not return to profitability through subsidies alone and stressed the need for strong local and foreign investment to revive the sector. He made the remarks while talking to reporters after visiting Natore Sugar Mill and Uttara Ganabhaban. The government is working to attract investments and positive developments are expected in the sugar sector either during the tenure of the incumbent government or the next one, said Adilur. The adviser said that sugar imports remained suspended now as the government would decide on importing sugar only after the stocks preserved were sold. Locally produced sugar is currently being marketed through the TCB, he mentioned. He also said that discussions were underway to hold a meeting of the Council of Advisers at the Uttara Ganabhaban as per tradition. Natore deputy commissioner Asma Shaheen, superintendent of police Muhammad Abdul Wahab and other officials were present.",

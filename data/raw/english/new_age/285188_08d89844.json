    "body": "The Education Rights Parliament has condemned the daylight shooting of Sharif Osman Hadi, aspiring independent candidate for Dhaka-8 constituency and convener of Inquilab Mancha, calling the attack a stark reminder of the persistence of political violence in Bangladesh. In a statement issued on Sunday, the organisation said that the attack reflected the continuing fragility of political and civic safety, despite months of reforms following the July uprising. The organisation warned that such violence undermines the promise of a reformed ‘Bangladesh 2.0’ and raises serious concerns about the safety of young leaders, first-time voters and citizens engaged in democratic participation, particularly ahead of the 13th national elections scheduled for February 2026. The organisation urged the interim government to ensure safe and inclusive civic spaces at all times, not only during election periods. Highlighting Hadi’s role in the organisation, ERP said he has been a prominent voice since its launch in September 2024, advocating civility, principled engagement and education-led social reform. The statement also linked the attack to the unresolved legacy of authoritarian rule, saying the pledge of ‘Never Again’ remains unfulfilled while political violence persists. The statement was sent by ERP convenor Professor M Niaz Asadullah.",

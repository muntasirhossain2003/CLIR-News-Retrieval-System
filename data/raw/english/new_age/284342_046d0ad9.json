    "body": "A drop in temperature has gripped Chuadanga, disrupting daily life and adding to the hardship of low-income workers. The Chuadanga Weather Observatory Centre recorded the season’s lowest temperature at 9:00am on Saturday, when the mercury fell to 11.8°C. The observatory forecast that a mild to moderate cold wave may sweep the district in the coming days. Md Zaminur Rahman, acting officer-in-charge of the Chuadanga Weather Observatory Centre, said temperatures are likely to dip further and a cold wave may sweep the district. Despite the biting cold, daily wage earners continue their work, braving fog and chilly winds. Shahin Ali, a carpenter who arrived in Chuadanga town for work, said, 'I left for work after 6am. The fog and cold wind are making my body shiver. But I have no choice. If I skip even a day of work, my family can’t survive.' Rickshaw-puller Jalal Uddin said, 'I drive at night and rest during the day. The cold has increased a lot in the past few days. Early in the morning, my hands and feet were freezing. If this continues, it will be very difficult to work at night.' Meanwhile, cold-related illnesses are on the rise at Chuadanga Sadar Hospital as the temperature continues to fall. Bidyut Kumar Biswas, superintendent of the hospital, said cases of diarrhoea and child patients with cold-related complications have increased. ‘We are seeing more pneumonia, breathing problems, fever, cold and diarrhoea cases. Comparatively, the pressure of elderly patients is lower,’ he said. He added that around 200–300 patients, including children and the elderly, are seeking treatment at the outdoor department every day for cold-related ailments.",

    "body": "Bangladesh secretariat employees on Wednesday threatened to go for tougher movement from January 10 if the government would not issue a gazette notification over pay commission by December. The employees came up with the warning in a memorandum sent to the financial adviser by the organisation’s secretary general, Nizam Uddin Ahmed. According to the memorandum, government employees had high expectations regarding the National Pay Commission-2025 formed by the current interim government. However, an atmosphere of uncertainty has emerged at the final recommendation stage, which the organisation said is unfavourable for fulfilling their legitimate demands. The council demanded restructuring the existing 20-grade pay scale into 10 phases with 1:4 ratios, claiming that such a system would eliminate longstanding disparities in salaries. The memorandum further stated that soaring commodity prices and the rising cost of living have pushed lower-grade employees into hardship. Delays in implementing the pay commission report are intensifying frustration and resentment among government staff. The council demanded restructuring the existing 20-grade pay scale into 10 tiers with 1:4 ratio, claiming that such a system would eliminate longstanding disparities in salaries. Urging direct intervention from the adviser to the finance ministry, the organisation said swift decisions are necessary to calm discontent and meet just expectations. The three key demands of the organisations include—introduction of secretariat allowance, implementation of the 9th pay scale and introduction of secretariat ration allowance.",

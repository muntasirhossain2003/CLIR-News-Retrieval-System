    "body": "A two-year-old boy fell into an abandoned deep tube-well pipe at Tanore in Rajshahi on Wednesday. The child, Md Swadhin, son of Rakib of Koelhat village under Pachandar union, slipped into the pipe beside their house at around 1:30pm, said Tanore police station officer-in-charge Md Shahinuzzaman. He said that the tube-well belonged to a local resident named Taher and had reportedly remained out of use for a long time. Local people said that the pipe was eight inches in diameter and roughly 35 feet deep. A rescue team from the Tanore Fire Service and Civil Defence Station began operations soon after the incident, while a specialised unit from Chapainawabganj was on its way to reinforce the effort, the OC said. He said that the child had responded a little while earlier. Oxygen was being supplied inside the pipe to keep him stable. Didarul Alam, assistant director of Rajshahi Fire Service and Civil Defence, said the child still assumed to be alive. ‘We are making our utmost efforts to rescue the child unharmed,’ he added.",

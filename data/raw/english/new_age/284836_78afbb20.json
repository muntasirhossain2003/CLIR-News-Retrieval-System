    "body": "Khandaker Muhammad Mahmudul Hasan, associate professor of physics at Rajshahi University, deleted his Facebook post in which he had labelled Begum Rokeya as ‘Kafir-murtad’, following widespread criticism from students and rights activists. He deleted the post from his Facebook wall on Wednesday night. ‘Since I made the post, I have been facing many problems, which have become overwhelming for both me and my family. I had made the statement based on the fundamental principles of what constitutes a breach of faith. But my remarks sounded like a fatwa, and issuing a fatwa is the authority of Islamic scholars, not mine. Therefore, I have deleted my post,’ he wrote in another Facebook post. Earlier on Tuesday morning, Professor Hasan shared a Facebook post from another user and added the caption — ‘Today is the birthday of the murtad-kafir Begum Rokeya.’ The post quickly went viral, triggering anger and condemnation online.",

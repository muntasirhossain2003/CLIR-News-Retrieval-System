    "body": "Primary and mass education adviser Professor Bidhan Ranjan Roy Podder has said that every child possesses immense hidden potential and the true purpose of education is to nurture that potential and shape them into complete human beings. He made the remark while addressing a stakeholder meeting organised by the district primary education office on improving the quality of primary education at Cox’s Bazar Cultural Centre on Saturday. Highlighting that the scope of education far beyond achieving GPA 5 or securing good exam results, Poddar said that such achievements represented only a small part of a much larger goal. He called for greater awareness and involvement of all stakeholders, especially parents, to enhance the quality of primary education. Cox’s Bazar deputy commissioner Md A Mannan was in the chair while secretary of the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education Abu Taher Md Masud Rana, director general of the Directorate of Primary Education Abu Nur Md. Shamsuzzaman, and director Mohammad Kamrul Hasan were the special guests.",

The handover took place at the Daulatganj-Majdia check-post following a flag meeting between the border forces of the two countries. After the formalities, Jibannagar police received the body. Maheshpur BGB-58 assistant director Munshi Imdadur Rahman, Jibannagar Upazila Health Complex physician Makbul Hasan, Jibannagar police station officer-in-charge Ripon Kumar Das, Indian BSF assistant commandant Manish Kumar of Banpur Camp and SI Rajen KR Mallik of Krishnagar police station were present at the meeting. Earlier, on November 29, Shahidul, son of Naskar Ali of Gayeshpur village, was allegedly attempting to smuggle goods across the border along with several others when BSF personnel chased them. While the others managed to flee, Shahidul was shot and succumbed to his injuries before he could be taken to a hospital. Shahidul’s wife, Nasrin Akter, said he had gone out for work in the morning, returned home briefly at noon, and later went to the fields to cut grass for their cattle. She later learned that he had been shot and taken away by the BSF, she added.",

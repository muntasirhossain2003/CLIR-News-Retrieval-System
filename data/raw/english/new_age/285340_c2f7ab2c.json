According to a press release issued by Indian high commission in Dhaka, Bangladeshi freedom fighters will meet Indian war veterans and senior officers from the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, who played a key role in training them and fighting alongside them in Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War. The Indian delegation will also hold discussions with freedom fighters and senior officers from the Bangladesh Army, Navy and Air Force. ‘These exchange visits provide a platform for Bangladeshi Muktijoddhas and Indian War Veterans to celebrate the unique friendship between our two countries and to renew memories of the Liberation War, which epitomises the shared sacrifices of the armed forces of Bangladesh and India for Bangladesh’s freedom from occupation, oppression and mass atrocities,’ adds the press release.

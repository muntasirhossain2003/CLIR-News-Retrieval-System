    "body": "A youth-led anti-graft platform on Thursday demanded that two advisers Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuiyan and Mahfuj Alam, who stepped down on Wednesday, disclose their assets. The platform under the banner of ‘Anti-Graft Students and People’ made the demand at a human chain formed in front of the Anti-Corruption Commission headquarters in the capital in the morning. It also urged the authorities to publish corruption-related records from the ministries the two advisers oversaw over the past 17 months. Speakers at the event alleged that although corruption complaints were filed against the personal assistants of the two advisers the ACC has yet to take any action. They claimed the advisers have ‘lost their moral eligibility for candidacy due to corruption’ and called on the election commission to bar them from contesting the forthcoming polls. The speakers also said the Anti-Corruption Commission has failed to play an effective role in curbing corruption. Youth and sports, local government, rural development and cooperatives adviser Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuiyan and information and broadcasting adviser Mahfuj Alam submitted their resignation letters to the chief adviser on Wednesday. Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam briefed reporters about their resignation at state guest house Jamuna on Wednesday evening. The chief adviser accepted their resignation letters and their resignations will take effect once the election commission announces the election schedule, he said.",

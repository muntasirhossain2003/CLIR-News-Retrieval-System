    "body": "Jahangirnagar University administration has expelled a student for life on allegation of making derogatory remarks about Prophet Muhammad (SM) on social media. The suspended student, Toufiq Islam Nabil, is a final year student of the geography and environment department under the 2020-21 academic session, the 50th batch of the department. He was permanently expelled in a syndicate meeting, chaired by JU vice-chancellor Mohammad Kamrul Ahsan on Thursday. JU pro vice-chancellor for administrative affairs Professor Sohel Ahmed confirmed it to New Age on Saturday. Earlier, Nabil posted comments on social media on June 28 that insulted Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), prompting widespread outrage on the campus and daylong protests. Acting on this, JU vice-chancellor Professor Mohammad Kamrul Ahsan ordered his suspension under Section 4(1)(b) of the Jahangirnagar University Students’ Disciplinary Ordinance. Under Section 2(g) of the Students Disciplinary Ordinance-2018, a committee, headed by acting dean of the faculty of social sciences Professor Shamsul Alam was formed to investigate the allegation of ‘misconduct’. The probe committee found Nabil guilty for hurting religious sentiments under both Section 295(A) of the Penal Code of Bangladesh and the university’s Students Disciplinary Ordinance. Therefore, it recommended Nabil’s permanent expulsion from the university in its investigation report. The disciplinary board later upheld the recommendation and forwarded it to the syndicate, which approved the punishment in its December 4 meeting, Sohel Ahmed said.",

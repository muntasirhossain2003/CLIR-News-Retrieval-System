    "body": "Six peacekeepers of the Bangladesh Army were killed and eight others were injured in an attack on the United Nations’ base by terrorists in Abei of Sudan, the Inter Services Public Relations said on Saturday. The identities of the deceased peacekeepers could not be known immediately. ‘6 peacekeepers of Bangladesh army killed, 8 injured in UN base attack by terrorists in Abei, Sudan today Saturday. The war is going on,’ the ISPR Bangladesh said in a post on its official Facebook page shared at around 10:00pm without saying further details. Abyei is a disputed, oil-rich region on the Sudan-South Sudan border, designated a ‘special administrative area’ with a complex history of conflict, displacement, and stalled referendum promises, currently managed by UN peacekeepers amidst ongoing ethnic tensions, particularly between the Dinka Ngok and Misseriya tribes, and regional instability from Sudan›s civil war, making it a fragile buffer zone. Bangladesh is the third-largest contributor of UN peacekeepers, with more than 5,600 military and police personnel currently deployed in some of the world’s most fragile regions, according to a recent report. Bangladeshi peacekeepers are serving in Abyei, the Central African Republic, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lebanon, South Sudan, and Western Sahara.",

It added that prime minister Amarasuriya thanked the chief adviser ‘for the support and expressions of solidarity’ following the devastating cyclone and floods that have killed hundreds and ravaged large parts of Sri Lanka over the past week. Professor Yunus conveyed his condolences and deep sympathy for the victims. He reaffirmed Bangladesh’s commitment to dispatch additional emergency aid and disaster-response experts to help Sri Lanka cope with the crisis. ‘We will be happy to do whatever is needed,’ said Professor Yunus. Prime minister Amarasuriya, who met the chief adviser on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC meeting in Bangkok earlier this year, said her government was currently assessing the damage caused by the heavy rains and widespread flooding. During the call, the chief adviser invited the Sri Lankan prime minister to visit Bangladesh in the coming months, saying Dhaka hoped to learn from Colombo’s political experience. Senior secretary and SDG coordinator Lamiya Morshed and foreign ministry’s concerned director general were present during the conversation.",

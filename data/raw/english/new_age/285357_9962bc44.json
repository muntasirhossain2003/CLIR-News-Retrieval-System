Inqilab Mancha’s verified Facebook page provided the update Tuesday evening, quoting Hadi’s brother who travelled with him as the source. Hadi is being treated at the Singapore General Hospital. It added that he will need another surgery, but Hadi’s physical condition is not yet ready for it. Earlier on Monday, an air ambulance equipped with all emergency facilities for a critical patient, departed Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport carrying Hadi, who was shot in the head from close range in an assassination attempt last Friday, to Singapore for advanced treatment. The decision to send Hadi abroad for treatment was taken on Sunday. He was shot after Jummah prayers on Bijoynagar Box Culvert Road in the capital. He was rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital with bullet injuries from where he was shifted to Evercare hospital. Following the incident, law enforcement agencies launched a series of operations to identify and arrest those involved.

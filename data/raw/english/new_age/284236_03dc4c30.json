    "title": "JU renames halls after Felani, others dropping Mujib family names",
    "body": "Jahangirnagar University has renamed four residential halls, previously named after members of founding president of the country Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s family, replacing them with titles honouring historic events and national figures such as Felani Khatun. Acting registrar ABM Azizur Rahman said that the university syndicate made the decision at a meeting chaired by vice-chancellor Mohammad Kamrul Ahsan on Thursday. Under the changes, Bangamata Fazilatunnesa Mujib Hall has been renamed Felani Khatun Hall in memory of the Bangladeshi teenager whose killing in the India–Bangladesh border in 2011 sparked widespread outrage. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall has been renamed Sher-e-Bangla AK Fazlul Huq Hall, while the 10-storey Sheikh Russell Hall will now be known as Nawab Salimullah Hall. Sheikh Hasina Hall has been rebranded July Chabbish Jagorani Hall, in reference to the mass uprising of July 24. The renaming follows months of student organisations’ pressure, demanding the removal of trace left by ‘fascist figures’ from the university campus. During the August 5, 2024, mass uprising that toppled the government of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, students vandalised the nameplate of Sheikh Hasina Hall and demanded removal of Mujib family names from campus infrastructures.",

    "title": "HC rejects NDM’s writ against RPO clause on alliance symbols",
    "body": "The High Court on Thursday rejected a writ petition filed by the National Democratic Movement challenging a provision of the Representation of the People (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025 that requires candidates in an electoral alliance to contest using their own party symbols. NDM secretary general Mominul Amin, representing the party led by Bobby Hajjaj, argued that the provision violated Articles 27, 38 and 39 of the constitution. Article 9 of the amended RPO states that when two or more registered parties form an alliance and nominate joint candidates, each candidate must run under the symbol of the party to which they belong. The bench of Justice Fatema Najib and Justice Fatema Anwar rejected the petition and discharged the rule issued earlier. NDM lawyer Rashna Imam told New Age that the party would appeal after reviewing the full verdict. The writ noted that, before the amendment, alliance partners could field candidates under the symbol of any member party. The new rule ends that practice. The government promulgated the amendment on November 3, after the advisory council gave in-principle approval on October 23. The BNP and several smaller parties have objected to the provision, saying it complicates alliance politics. They have submitted formal objections to the Election Commission and the law ministry. Earlier, alliances led by major political parties could contest using the symbol of the leading party.",

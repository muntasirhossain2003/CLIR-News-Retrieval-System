    "title": "VICTORY DAY: Commotion breaks out between Chhatra Dal, Shibir at CU",
    "body": "A commotion broke out between activists of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal and Islami Chhatra Shibir at Chittagong University campus during the observance of Victory Day at 11:30am on Tuesday. The incident occurred when some leaders of the Chittagong University Central Students’ Union, including the assistant general secretary Ayubur Rahman, protested against the presence of the university’s pro-vice-chancellor (academic) Professor Mohammed Shamim Uddin Khan in the discussion event. The protesting CUCSU leaders chanted slogans against Shamim, who on December 14 commented that the narrative that the Pakistani occupational army had killed intellectuals at the dawn of Bangladesh’s emergence was ‘absurd’. A procession of Chhatra Dal also demanded the resignation of Shamim. During that time, a commotion broke out between activists of Chhatra Dal and Shibir. Later, the university’s proctorial body brought the situation under control. However, nine CUCSU leaders, including Ayubur, boycotted the discussion. He said, ‘After speaking in favour of the Pakistani occupational forces on Martyred Intellectuals Day, Professor Shamim neither expressed regret nor apologised. Despite that, he attended the discussion meeting. For this reason, we are boycotting the discussion.’",

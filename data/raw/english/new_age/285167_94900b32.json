    "body": "A group of performers on Saturday staged ‘Symbolic Mass Graveyard 1971’ to commemorate the martyred intellectuals of 1971. The event was organised by cultural organisation Banglaparishor at Shahbag in the capital, a day ahead of Martyred Intellectuals Day. The performance featured a group of theatre artists portraying a symbolic mass graveyard, with their hands and faces bound in black cloth and their bodies marked with wounds and bloodstains. At the beginning of the programme, rows of symbolic corpses were displayed, accompanied by the background song ‘Ami Dam Diye Kinechi Bangla’. Following the performance, a discussion session was held, where journalist and fiction writer Ehsan Mahmud spoke as the keynote discussant. The event concluded with the song ‘Rajakar Al-Badr Kichui Robe Na Re’. The Martyred Intellectuals Day is observed on December 14 to commemorate the large number of Bangladeshi intellectuals killed by the then West Pakistani military and their local collaborators during the Bangladesh Liberation War, just two days before the Great Victory on December 16.",

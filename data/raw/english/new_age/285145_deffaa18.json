The day’s events began around 11.00am with the hoisting of the national flag and the flag of the Freedom Fighters’ Association in front of the District Freedom Fighters’ Association office. This was followed by a colourful procession that paraded through the main roads of the town and concluded at the association’s auditorium. A discussion, organised jointly by the District and Sadar Upazila Freedom Fighters’ Associations, was held. Deputy commissioner Mohammad Nairuzzaman attended the meeting as chief guest. The discussion was chaired by convener of the District Freedom Fighters’ Association, Shamsul Haque Joba. Among others, superintendent of police Sheikh Jahidul Islam, additional deputy commissioner Jyoti Bikash Chandra, member secretary of the District Freedom Fighters’ Association Abdul Jalil and convener of the Sadar Upazila Freedom Fighters’ Association Delwar Hossain spoke at the event. Freedom fighters, their family members and people from all walks of life attended the programme. Speakers recalled that on December 13, 1971, Nilphamari Sadar upazila was liberated from the invading forces. Following fierce resistance by the freedom fighters, the occupation forces fled the district town at night and took refuge in the Saidpur Cantonment. The next morning, freedom fighters hoisted the flag of independent Bangladesh at the Chowrangi intersection, while jubilant residents poured into the streets chanting victory slogans, celebrating the dawn of freedom.",

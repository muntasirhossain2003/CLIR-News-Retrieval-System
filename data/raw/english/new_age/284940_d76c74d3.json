    "body": "Several organisations have condemned and protested at a Facebook post by Khandaker Muhammad Mahmudul Hasan, associate professor of physics at Rajshahi University, in which he labelled Begum Rokeya as a ‘kafir–murtad’. Protesting at the remark, the University Teachers’ Network said in a statement on Thursday that the way Khandaker labelled her was ‘gravely unjust and deeply disrespectful’, adding that it was a shame for the entire academic community. ‘Such irresponsible remarks endanger not only Bangladeshi Muslim women but all women in their everyday lives,’ the statement said. It added that Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain was a writer, educator, social reformer and one of the foremost pioneers of women’s awakening and the movement for women’s rights. Begum Rokeya was not anti-religion; rather, she criticised the narrow interpretations of religion that affected society, the country, and especially women, it said. In another statement, Bangladesh Mahila Parishad said, ‘This university teacher is among those who create obstacles for women by misinterpreting religion.’ The rights body demanded the immediate removal of Khandaker from teaching duties and called for effective measures to curb misogynistic campaigns on social media. Ain o Salish Kendra also in a statement condemned the incident. Earlier on Tuesday morning, Khandaker shared a Facebook post from another user and added the caption — ‘Today is the birthday of the murtad-kafir Begum Rokeya.’ Amid condemnation and criticism, he deleted his Facebook post on Wednesday night.",

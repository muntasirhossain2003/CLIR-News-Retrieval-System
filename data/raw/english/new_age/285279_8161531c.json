    "body": "The US embassy in Dhaka on Monday issued a security alert for American citizens in Bangladesh, saying they should practice vigilance and remember that demonstrations intended to be peaceful in this period leading up to elections can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. ‘You should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings,’ said the embassy in the security alert shared from its verified Facebook page. Bangladesh’s Election Commission announced that the next parliamentary election and a national referendum will occur simultaneously on February 12, 2026. Political rallies and demonstrations may become more frequent and intense as the election date approaches, said the embassy. Talking about actions to take, the embassy said, ‘Be aware of your surroundings. Monitor local media for updates. Avoid crowds. Avoid demonstrations.’",

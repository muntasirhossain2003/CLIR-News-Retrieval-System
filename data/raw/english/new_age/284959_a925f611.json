    "body": "Bangladesh The Election Commission (EC) has published the revised list of re-demarcated boundaries for all 300 parliamentary constituencies ahead of the 13th Jatiya Sangsad election and the referendum. A gazette notification in this regard, signed by EC Secretariat Senior Secretary Akhtar Ahmed, was published on Thursday night. The gazette notification said, previously published order on constituency demarcation has been partially amended following the judgment on Writ Petition No. 15537/2025 in the High Court Division and Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 4676/2025 in the Appellate Division of the Bangladesh Supreme Court. 'As a result, the number of parliamentary constituency has been increased in Bagerhat district, while one seat reduced from Gazipur district,' it said. The re-demarcation was made strictly in line with the court directives and legal procedures to ensure a more logical and precise distribution of constituencies, the EC said.",

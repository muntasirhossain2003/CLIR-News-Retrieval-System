    "body": "Bangladesh and the Maldives on Sunday discussed the possibility of formulating a comprehensive memorandum of understanding to deepen collaboration in youth empowerment, arts and information exchange. The discussion taken place when Bangladesh high commissioner to Maldives Md Nazmul Islam called on Maldivian youth, information and arts minister Ibrahim Waheed in Male, said a press release. During the meeting, the high commissioner underscored that youth-focused cooperation was a highly promising area for future collaboration between the two friendly nations. He expressed Bangladesh’s keen interest in jointly organising youth-oriented arts and cultural exhibitions, film festivals and creative showcases, as well as exchange programmes on media, communication and digital empowerment. He also proposed the signing of memoranda of understanding focusing on youth development, information sharing and capacity building to institutionalise cooperation and ensure long-term impact. Highlighting Bangladesh’s recent experience, Nazmul noted the inspiring role of Bangladeshi youth in promoting democratic values, civic responsibility and peaceful social change, particularly during the country’s democratic movement. He said that such youth-led initiatives could serve as a model for fostering a more democratic, stable and peaceful global community. In response, Waheed expressed strong interest in deepening bilateral engagement in the areas discussed and conveyed his willingness to move forward with a comprehensive MoU following further consultations and technical-level discussions. Both sides agreed to maintain close communication and explore practical pathways to translate the proposed cooperation into concrete programmes that would benefit the youth of both countries.",

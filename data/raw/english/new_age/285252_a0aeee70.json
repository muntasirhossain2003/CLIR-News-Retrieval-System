    "body": "The Border Guard Bangladesh on Sunday filed a case with the Companiganj police in Sylhet against about 30 suspected smugglers on charge of attacking BGB personnel along the Companiganj border early Saturday. Companiganj police officer-in-charge Shafiqul Islam Khan said that the case was filed against 30 attackers, including seven people named. The police officer said that none of the suspects had yet been arrested. According to the case statement, a motorcyclist, who was driving recklessly, fled the scene at Uttar Ranikhai of Companiganj on Saturday morning after a BGB team had chased him. The BGB personnel found 167 bottles of Indian liquor from the spot. But soon, a group of about 30 people started pelting the BGB personnel with stones, forcing them to fire blank shots to disperse the attackers. The BGB 48 Battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Nazmul Haque said that the soldiers had fired four blank shots in self-defence.",

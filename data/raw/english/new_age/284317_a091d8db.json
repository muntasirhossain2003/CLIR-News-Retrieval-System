    "body": "WINTER cauliflower season has brought both high yields and attractive prices, bringing relief to farmers after last year’s losses. With cultivation costs of Tk 30,000–35,000 per bigha, farmers are selling cauliflower for Tk 80,000–130,000, earning profits of Tk 50,000–70,000 per bigha. According to the District Agriculture Extension Office, cauliflower was cultivated on 1,494 hectares of land this year out of the 2,975-hectare target. Traders said that early market arrival and strong demand have helped farmers secure better prices than last year. ‘I spent Tk 40,000 on 2 bigha and sold it for Tk 120,000, and as last year we suffered losses, this year we fully recovered,’ said Mohammad Tarikul Islam of Gaidghat village, adding that if prices stayed satisfactory, he planned to expand cultivation next season. Mohammad Hasanur Rahman of Garabaria Baganpara added that he cultivated 7 bigha and profited Tk 60,000–70,000 per bigha, almost double last year’s earnings. Young farmer Mohammad Arafat, managing his family farm alongside studies, said that he sold 1.5 bigha of early cauliflower at Tk 125,000 per bigha and the seasonal cauliflower now sells at Tk 80,000–90,000, giving a profit of Tk 50,000–60,000 per bigha. Chuadanga agriculture deputy director Masudur Rahman has said that Chuadanga has been one of the leading vegetable-producing districts and this winter, cauliflower cultivation has been highly successful, both in yield and prices, benefiting farmers. They continue to provide technical support to ensure sustainable production, he added.",

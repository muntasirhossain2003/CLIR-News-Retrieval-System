    "body": "Biman Bangladesh Airlines has introduced body cameras for baggage-handling staff at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport to strengthen security, transparency and accountability in handling baggage for domestic and international flights. As the Ground Handling Agent at the country’s main international airport, Biman has taken the technology-driven initiative to ensure safer and more transparent baggage operations for passengers, said a Biman press release on Wednesday. Under the initiative, it said, body cameras have been provided to traffic staff involved in baggage transportation. The system will allow continuous monitoring of the entire baggage-handling process - from unloading baggage from aircraft holds, movement through conveyor belts, to final delivery to passengers. The initiative will cover both Biman’s domestic flights and international flights of foreign airlines for which Biman provides ground handling services, ensuring a uniform standard of security and transparency across all operations. Biman officials said the measure would significantly enhance baggage security while improving operational transparency and staff accountability. In case of baggage-related complaints, recorded footage can be reviewed to verify incidents promptly and ensure timely and appropriate resolution. The national flag carrier believed the move reflects its commitment to adopting modern technology, maintaining professionalism and prioritising passenger-centric services, said the release. Biman Bangladesh Airlines reaffirmed that passenger safety, service quality and trust remain at the core of its operational priorities as it continues to modernise its ground handling services.",

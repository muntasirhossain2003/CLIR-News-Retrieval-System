    "body": "The protesting government primary school teachers suspended their strike, demanding pay hike and promotion, in the early hours of Friday. In a press release, they said that from next Sunday (December 7) the annual examinations in these schools would be continued. The leaders of the Primary Teachers’ Demand Implementation Council and the Primary Assistant Teachers’ Organisation Unity Council announced the suspension of the movement in the joint press release. Earlier, the authorities of different government primary schools across the country on Thursday continued to arrange the ongoing annual examinations by deploying guardians and non-teaching staff of the schools amid teachers’ strike. Since Wednesday the teachers had been also observing ‘complete lockdown’ programme at some government primary schools across the country, protesting at the serving of show-cause notices on some of their leaders and colleagues. The teachers under the Primary Assistant Teachers’ Association Unity Council demanded a gazette on upgrading the entry-level assistant teacher position to the 11th grade from the existing 13th grade, removing the barriers to achieving higher grades for the teachers who are 10 years and 16 years into the job, and appointing all head teachers from the pool of assistant teachers through promotion. Meanwhile, the primary and mass education ministry on Thursday transferred at least 42 protesting teachers, showed a document shared by the teachers’ leaders.",

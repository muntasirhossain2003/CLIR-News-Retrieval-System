    "body": "Political parties not facing any bans on activities will be eligible to participate in the next Jatiya Sangsad elections, expected to be held in the first half of February next year. Election commissioner Abdur Rahmanel Masud conveyed this position while talking to New Age on Saturday. ‘I see no barrier for political parties that have no restrictions from taking part in the election,’ he said. A total of 56 political parties are registered with the Election Commission. Of them, the registration of the Bangladesh Awami League remains suspended. The Election Commission suspended AL’s registration on May 12 after the government had imposed a ban on all activities of the party and its affiliated, associated, and like-minded organisations. On May 10, the interim government decided to ban all activities of the Awami League, including those online, until the trials of the party and its leaders are concluded by the International Crimes Tribunal. Following this, the home ministry issued a gazette notification stating that during its time in office between January 6, 2009 and August 5, 2024, the Awami League and its affiliates were involved in widespread repression, including enforced disappearances, political killings, torture, arson, and crimes against humanity.",

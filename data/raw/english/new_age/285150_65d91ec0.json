    "body": "National Democratic Front on Saturday called on the interim government to ensure level playing field for the political parties before next general election. The chief of the newly floated alliance Anisul Islam Mahmud, also chairman of Jatiya Party faction, said this at a press conference at Emmanuel Party Centre in Gulshan. He alleged that so far level playing field for every political party and safety and security of the candidates taking part in the election not yet ensured despite announcement of schedule for 13th Jatiya Sangsad election. He called on the interim government to ensure level playing field and safety and security of the candidates taking part in the election. He made the call following a gun attack on Sharif Osman Hadi, an aspiring independent candidate for Dhaka-8 constituency in the upcoming national elections and also the spokesperson of the Inquilab Mancha, in the Dhaka city on Friday afternoon. ‘We want an inclusive general election in a free, fair and credible manner so that voters could cast their votes in favour of their desired candidates,’ Anisul Islam Mahmud said. JP faction secretary general and also spokesman of the alliance ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader said that attack on an aspirant parliament member candidate in Dhaka on Friday proved that government so far failed to ensure safety and securities of the candidates. Executive chairman of JP faction Mujibul Haque Chunnu, chief coordinator of the alliance Golam Sarwar Milon and others attended the press conference. NDF, a political alliance led by JP faction, was launched on Monday comprising 18 political parties.",

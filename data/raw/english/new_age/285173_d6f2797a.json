Tarique said brave Bangladeshi soldiers, who laid down their lives while serving under the UN flag to protect world peace, are a source of great pride for the nation. ‘Their sacrifice will always be remembered by Bangladesh. I pray for the forgiveness of the souls of the fallen peacekeepers and express my deepest sympathy to their grieving families,’ he said. The BNP leader wished a speedy recovery of the injured soldiers and called upon all concerned to stand by them during this difficult time. As the son of a decorated army officer, Tarique said he has always been passionately inspired by the exceptional professionalism, courage and sacrifice of the Bangladesh Army. ‘In the current situation, I believe the international community must take stronger and more effective steps to ensure the safety of peacekeepers. May Allah accept our brave soldiers as martyrs and grant the injured a swift recovery,’ he said.",

    "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia is unlikely to be flown to London for now as her health condition remains unchanged. Neither the BNP nor the medical board supervising her treatment on Sunday made any formal statement regarding the condition of the BNP chairperson, currently undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital in the Dhaka city. BNP standing committee member AZM Zahid Hossain, also a member of the medical board, however, on Saturday told reporters that the medical board considered that Khaleda Zia was not physically fit for air travel. He said that the BNP chief’s transfer abroad for advanced medical treatment would ultimately be dictated by her physical condition in the future, as advised by the medical board. Zahid also said that air ambulance was always on standby, but the highest priority remained ensuring Khaleda Zia’s proper treatment as well as her safety and security from a medical standpoint. Initially, the BNP had scheduled Khaleda’s departure for London for December 5 on an air ambulance from Qatar. However, the aircraft failed to arrive due to technical issues, prompting the party to announce a revised plan for December 7. To facilitate the transfer, the Qatari authorities had arranged to hire a German air ambulance, party sources said. Khaleda was admitted to Evercare Hospital on November 23, and after examinations, doctors confirmed that she had developed a lung infection. On November 27, she was moved to the critical care unit, where she remained under the care of a joint medical team comprising doctors from the United States, the United Kingdom, China and Bangladesh.",

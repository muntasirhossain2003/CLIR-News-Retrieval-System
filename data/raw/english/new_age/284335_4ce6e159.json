The repatriation was coordinated by the Bangladesh embassy in Libya, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment, and the International Organisation for Migration, according to the foreign ministry. According to officials, most of the returnees entered Libya under the influence of and assisted by human traffickers with an aim to reach Europe illegally via the Mediterranean Sea. Many of them reportedly faced kidnapping, abuse and many other forms of mistreatment during their stay in Libya. Officials from the foreign and other ministries concerned and IOM representatives welcomed the returnees at the airport. The ministry officials urged them to share their difficult experiences with others to raise public awareness about the dangers of irregular migration. The IOM provided each returnee with travel allowance, food supplies and basic medical support. The foreign ministry, expatriates welfare ministry, the Bangladesh Embassy in Libya and the IOM are working jointly to ensure the safe repatriation of other Bangladeshi citizens who remain held in various detention centres in Libya. A huge number of Bangladeshis who had entered Libya with the intention of traveling illegally to Europe with the assistance from human traffickers, recently returned home from Libya supported by the government and the IMO.",

    "body": "A union-level BNP leader was shot to death in Ishwardi upazila of Pabna district on Wednesday. The deceased was identified as Biru Molla, 60, son of late Abul Molla and convener of Luxmikunda union unit of BNP. Victim’s son Rajib Molla said that on Tuesday night local Awami League supporter Zahurul Molla, also cousin of Biru Mollah, along with his son Al Amin Molla, forcibly cut soil from Biru Molla’s land for using that in a brick kiln. When Biru Molla went to ask Zahurul Molla about the soil cutting at around 9:15 am on Wednesday, Zahurul and his son Al Amin became enraged and immediately shot Biru Molla in the head with an illegal firearm. Biru Molla collapsed on the spot and was rushed by locals to Ishwardi Upazila Health Complex where the on-duty physician, Tasnim Tamanna Swarna, declared him dead. Former Ishwardi upazila BNP member secretary Ajmal Hossain Sujon said those responsible for killing his party leader must be brought to justice immediately. ‘This is not a party issue. Deceased Biru Molla was the first cousin of the accused Zahurul Molla. The incident occurred over soil cutting,’ he added. Mominuzzaman, officer-in-charge of Ishwardi Police Station, said that necessary legal action would be taken following investigation. ‘As of 3:30pm on Wednesday no case had been filed,’ the OC added.",

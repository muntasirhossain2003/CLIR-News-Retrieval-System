    "body": "Bangladesh’s Supreme Court has restricted access to its courtrooms for trial candidates and anyone other than lawyers in both its divisions from Monday, citing security concerns. The Supreme Court, being the highest judicial institution of the country, requires strict security to ensure the safety of the chief justice, judges of both divisions, lawyers conducting cases, and all concerned, said a notification issued on the order of the chief justice and signed by Supreme Court Registrar General Muhammad Habibur Rahman Siddiqui. It noted that recently trial candidates, litigants and other unauthorised persons have been entering the courtrooms, creating obstacles to security, a peaceful environment and the smooth conduct of judicial proceedings. Such activities, the notification said, have disrupted the security of judges, lawyers, officials and employees. ‘For the sake of security, access of trial candidates or any persons other than lawyers to the courtrooms of both divisions of the Supreme Court has been limited and restricted,’ it said. The notification also said that any kind of gathering, procession, and carrying of legal or illegal weapons, including deadly weapons, explosives and narcotics, has been completely banned on the Supreme Court premises. The order will remain effective from December 15 to December 31. Legal action will be taken against anyone violating the order, it warned. Lawyers, their assistants, court officials and employees, and trial seekers have been asked to remain vigilant and comply with the directive.",

    "body": "The United Kingdom and Qatar have jointly announced $11.2 million in funding to support more than 6,47,000 Rohingyas and host Bangladeshi communities in Cox’s Bazar, reinforcing humanitarian assistance and environmental protection efforts. The joint funding will help provide liquified petroleum gas to vulnerable Rohingya households living in the camps, aiming to improve living conditions while reducing environmental degradation in and around the refugee settlements, said a British high commission statement in Dhaka on Sunday. ‘Together, we are committed to creating safer, healthier, and more sustainable communities,’ the statement said. The provision of LPG will reduce dependence on firewood, which has contributed to widespread deforestation in the surrounding areas over the past years, it added. Since the influx of Rohingyas from Myanmar in 2017, Cox’s Bazar has remained home to one of the largest displaced populations in the world.",

They include 16 men, 10 women and 4 children, and all of them are Bangladeshis, according to a press release issued by the Border Guard Bangladesh.

With the latest push-ins, the number of people, including Rohingyas and Indian nationals, pushed into Bangladesh by India since May 7 has increased to 2,402. The Indian border force has so far pushed at least 223 Rohingyas, including 50 registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in India, into Bangladesh.

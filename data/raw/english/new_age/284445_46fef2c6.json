    "body": "Environment, forest and climate change adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan at an event in Dhaka on Saturday said that the young generation’s leadership in wildlife protection was now undeniable. ‘The increasing interest among youths in rescuing, caring for, and rehabilitating wildlife back into nature is a hopeful sign for Bangladesh. Public awareness on wildlife safety and conservation has risen significantly compared to earlier,’ said the adviser. Rizwana made these remarks while addressing an exchange of view at the Forest Bhaban at Agargaon, with volunteers and organisations engaged in wildlife, forest and biodiversity conservation. Mentioning that people must uphold ethical values that ensure the coexistence of humans and nature, she said, ‘The religious and social values teach compassion, protection, and responsible behaviour toward all living species.’ Standing beside vulnerable people and vulnerable animals is the truest expression of humanity, she added. Addressing the youth, Rizwana emphasised, ‘A united voice is essential in safeguarding wildlife. Those who try to destroy wildlife habitats often seek public support by citing economic reasons.’ To counter them, awareness, love for nature and dissemination of accurate information must be strengthened, she asserted. The adviser announced that 64 wildlife conservation workers—one from each district—will be officially recognised next year. This initiative, she said, will motivate the younger generation and encourage local leadership in wildlife preservation. Rizwana informed that the government has approved the formation of a new unit to address wildlife crimes and initiatives are underway to ensure modern equipment and transport facilities for wildlife rescue operations. Chaired by chief conservator of forests Md Amir Hossain Chowdhury, director general of the National Institute of Biotechnology Md Sagir Ahmed; biodiversity expert Mohammad Ali Reza Khan; founding dean of the faculty of veterinary and animal sciences at Rajshahi University Md Jalal Uddin Sardar; and founder and chief adviser of BBCF Mollah Rezaul Karim attended the event. Several individuals and organisations were awarded for their special contributions to environmental and biodiversity conservation, including Mohammad Ali Reza Khan.",

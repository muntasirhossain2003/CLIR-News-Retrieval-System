    "body": "The name ‘Miss Zulekha Khatun’ appeared in the third-grade admission lottery of Victoria Jubilee Government High School, a boys-only institution in Chuadanga, causing concerns among parents about the reliability of the digital lottery system. The lottery, conducted digitally at the International Mother Language Institute on December 11, was published online and on the school notice board. Zulekha Khatun’s name appeared at Serial 71 in the third-grade (day shift) admission list. Parents expressed concern over errors and irregularities, noting that earlier in previous years alo similar incidents had occurred in Chuadanga’s boys’ and girls’ schools. Attempts to reach Zulekha Khatun’s parents, Zinarul Islam and Sabina Yasmin, were unsuccessful. School authorities said that they would review the matter and provide clarification later. Chuadanga deputy commissioner Mohammad Kamal Hossain said that as the lottery was centrally conducted in Dhaka, relevant authorities were supposed to correct the mistake. A similar incident occurred in 2022, when a girl’s name appeared in the boys’ school lottery, along with multiple listings of certain students’ names.",

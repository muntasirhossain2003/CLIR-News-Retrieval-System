    "body": "Two-year-old Sajid, who died after falling into an abandoned deep tubewell in Tanore upazila of Rajshahi, was buried on Friday morning. Maulana Mizanur Rahman led the janaza held at Koelhat village, after which the child was laid to rest. From early morning, villagers in large numbers gathered at the funeral ground No-1 in the community and broke into tears at the sudden death of the child. On Wednesday afternoon, Sajid slipped and fell into a hole covered with straw while walking with his mother in front of their house. The hole turned out to be the mouth of an abandoned deep tubewell. After a rescue operation that lasted 32 hours, he was pulled out on Thursday night. Physicians at Tanore Upazila Health Complex declared him dead upon arrival. Speaking at the janaza, Sajid’s father, Rakibul Islam, urged everyone to pray for his son. He told reporters that his son died due to ‘others’ negligence’ and demanded justice from the authorities. Locals said a man had attempted to install a deep tubewell at the site last year but abandoned the work after digging up to 120 feet without finding water. The open pit was left exposed and later widened by rain, leading to the tragic accident due to the lack of any warning or cover, they alleged.",

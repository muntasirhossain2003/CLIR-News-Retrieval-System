    "body": "Bangladesh interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday morning paid rich tributes to the martyrs of the Liberation War by placing a wreath at the National Memorial on the outskirts of the capital marking the 55th Victory Day. He laid the wreath at the altar of the National Memorial around 6:56am. After placing the wreath, the chief adviser stood in solemn silence for some time as a mark of profound respect to the memories of the martyrs of the Great War of Liberation in 1971. A smartly turned out contingent drawn from Bangladesh Army, Navy and Air Force presented a state salute on the occasion. Prof Yunus later signed the visitors’ book kept there. The chief justice, advisers of the interim government, chiefs of the three services, freedom fighters, diplomats, and civil and military officials, among others, were present on the occasion.",

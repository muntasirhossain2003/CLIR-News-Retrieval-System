    "body": "India has greeted Bangladesh and people of the country on the occasion of Victory Day being celebrated across the country on Tuesday. Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishnkar conveyed the greetings to Bangladesh and its people. ‘Greetings to Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain, the Interim Government and the people of Bangladesh on Bijoy Dibosh,’ Jaishankar said in a message from his verified X handle on Tuesday. Like every year, the armies of Bangladesh and India have invited each other’s war veterans and serving officers to participate in the Victory Day celebrations on December 16, marking the end of Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971 with the surrender of the Pakistani forces. Eight Indian war veterans and two serving officers of the Indian Armed Forces reached Dhaka on Monday to participate in Bangladesh’s Victory Day celebrations. Similarly, eight valiant freedom fighters and two serving officers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces went to India on Sunday to participate in the celebrations at Kolkata, said the Indian High Commission in Dhaka on Monday. These exchange visits provide a platform for Bangladeshi freedom fighters and Indian war veterans to celebrate the unique friendship between the two countries and to renew memories of the Liberation War, which epitomises the shared sacrifices of the armed forces of Bangladesh and India for Bangladesh’s freedom from occupation, oppression and mass atrocities, the Indian HC said.",

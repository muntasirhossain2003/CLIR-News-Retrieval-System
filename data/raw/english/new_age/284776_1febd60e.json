    "body": "Human rights defender and executive director of Bangladesh Nari Sramik Kendra, Sumaiya Islam, on Wednesday was awarded the 2025 Franco-German Award for human rights and the rule of law. Observing International Human Rights Day, ambassadors of France and Germany to Bangladesh, Jean-Marc Séré-Charlet and Rüdiger Lotz, presented the award to Sumaiya at a special ceremony held at the Franco-German Embassy in Dhaka, said a press release. Since 2016, France and Germany have jointly celebrated International Human Rights Day by honouring individuals around the world who demonstrate exceptional commitment to promoting and defending fundamental rights and freedoms. Sumaiya Islam received the award for her long-standing dedication to advancing the rights of socially and economically marginalised women, particularly migrant workers, sex workers, transgender persons, and others. Previously, the prize was awarded to Adilur Rahman Khan, founder of Odhikar, in 2017. He was the second Bangladeshi recipient, following Tahmina Rahman of Article 19 in 2016, said the press release.",

    "body": "Twenty per cent of Bangladeshi Hajj pilgrims must travel to Saudi Arabia via Madinah next year and 30 per cent will return through the same route, according to the 2026 Hajj agreement between Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia. The religious affairs ministry sent a letter to all lead Hajj agencies informing the new rule on Wednesday. According to the letter, 20 per cent of all pilgrims travelling under both government and private management must enter Saudi Arabia through Prince Mohammad bin Abdul Aziz International Airport in Madinah while 30 percent will return through the same airport. As per the deal, all lead Hajj agencies have been instructed to ensure necessary arrangements in this regard. The agencies were asked to prepare for all logistical arrangements related to flights and pilgrim movement through the airport. Bangladesh has managed a quota of 78,500 pilgrims to perform Hajj next year.",

Brigadier General Md Asaduzzaman, director of the DMCH, confirmed that Hadi underwent surgery before being moved around 7:30pm due to the severity of his condition. Professor Zahid Raihan, head of the neurosurgery department at DMCH, stated that Hadi remains in critical condition after a bullet pierced his head above the left ear, causing significant brain damage. ‘We cannot offer any hopeful words, but he is still alive,’ Raihan said. Hadi was shot in the head in the Box Culvert area of Bijoynagar on Friday afternoon while campaigning for the elections, according to Ishrafil Farazi, a colleague of Hadi.",

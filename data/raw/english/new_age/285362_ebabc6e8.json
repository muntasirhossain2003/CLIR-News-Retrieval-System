    "title": "Fake documents blocking Bangladesh’s job prospects in abroad, says chief adviser",
    "body": "Highlighting the importance of safer, fairer and skilled migration, chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Wednesday said that the submission of fake documents has emerged as a major barrier to sending people abroad, despite the huge opportunities offered by destination countries for Bangladeshis. ‘Bangladesh has become quite famous globally for the submission of fake documents,’ he said, noting that the country continues to face the same complaints from receiving nations, regardless of the destination. Professor Yunus cited an example raised by the United Arab Emirates to illustrate the severity of the problem. He said the migration system is heavily dominated by brokers and syndicates, where the government’s role remains limited. Professor Yunus also warned that the widespread use of fake documents is leading to the closure of doors for Bangladeshi workers seeking employment abroad. The chief adviser was speaking at a function in the city marking the International Migration and National Expatriates Day. Adviser Asif Nazrul was, among others, present at the programme. International Migrants Day is observed on 18 December, reaffirming the need for safer, more inclusive, and fairer migration systems in a rapidly changing world. Despite its proven benefits, migration remains poorly understood, and systems often lack the investments, partnerships, and evidence needed to respond to today’s realities. This year’s theme, My Great Story: Cultures and Development, highlights how human mobility drives growth, enriches societies, and helps communities connect, adapt, and support one another. In 2025, this message is more urgent than ever as migration continues to shape economies, communities, and global development. Migration is a defining force of the century. Remittances to low- and middle-income countries are projected to reach a record USD 685 billion, and migrants are central to addressing labour shortages, driving innovation, and supporting demographic stability. Yet these contributions can only be maximized when migration is safe, orderly, and responsibly governed. Well-managed migration is a strategic asset: it strengthens resilience, fuels prosperity, and supports social cohesion, IOM said. From documentation and skills recognition to integration and dignified return, effective systems ensure migrants can find stability, support their families, and build new futures, while helping communities adapt and thrive. On this IMD, IOM called for smarter policies, stronger cooperation, and a renewed commitment to making migration work for all. Because every migrant’s journey is a story of resilience and possibility, and because when migration is managed well, each personal story becomes part of a larger one that enriches cultures, strengthens development, and benefits all. This is the idea at the heart of the 2025 theme — My Great Story — is not only a migrant’s story, it is the shared story of how mobility can shape a fairer and more sustainable future.",

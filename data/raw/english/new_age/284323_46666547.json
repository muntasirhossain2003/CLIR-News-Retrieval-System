    "body": "Privately-owned Gono Bishwabidyalay in Savar permanently expelled four students over allegations of rape, university authorities said on Friday. The expelled students are Delwar Bhuiya, Tajul Islam Taj, and Shrabon Saha from the law department’s 32nd batch, and Antu Dewan from the 27th batch. The disciplinary action was taken after a female student filed a complaint on November 30 at Ashulia Police Station, accusing the four law students of raping her. Police arrested the accused on Wednesday and they were placed on remand for different terms through the courts. The incidents triggered widespread protests on campus, with students demanding justice for the victim and accountability from university authorities. At one point, they confined law department lecturer Limon Hossain, whom they accused of siding with the accused. They also demanded the resignations of proctor and law department head Rafiqul Alam, professor Nilufar Sultana, accusing them of attempting to downplay the incident. The university administration, teachers, students, the central students’ union and the campus journalists’ association held an emergency meeting at about 2:00pm on Thursday. After hours of deliberation, authorities announced the disciplinary actions at about 8:00pm. Earlier on Thursday, the accused had been temporarily suspended pending investigation. Gono Bishwabidyalay registrar Md. Wahidullah said that the expulsions were carried out after a thorough investigation. ‘Based on the complaints and evidence, appropriate actions have been taken against those involved’ he said.",

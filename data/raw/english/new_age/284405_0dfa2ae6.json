    "body": "Bulks of documents along with computers and other equipment were destroyed when miscreants in the small hours of Saturday set fire to the office of the assistant commissioner for land with petrol bombs at Magura Sadar. Unidentified miscreants also set fire to the Magura district land registry office, situated in the district town about a kilometre apart from the AC Land office, but it could not destroy land records stored there, officials and the police said. Assistant commissioner (land) Asma Akter said that the perpetrators broke a window at the back of her office building at about 3:00am and hurled petrol bombs inside. ‘Fire broke out in a room on the ground floor, causing extensive damage, destroying computers and land documents stored there,’ she said. Later, the fire service and the police arrived at the spot and doused the fire, she added. In the fire set to the Magura land registry office at about 4:30am, no documents were burnt, but two rooms used by deed writers were gutted, she said. Magura Sadar police officer-in-charge Md Ayub Ali said that upon receiving the information, they reached the spots and recovered bottles containing petrol. A special drive was under way to identify the culprits, he said, adding that a case was filed in this regard.",

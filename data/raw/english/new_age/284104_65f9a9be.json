    "body": "A Rohingya youth has been arrested in Sirajganj as he was attempting to obtain a Bangladeshi passport with a fake identity. He was detained on Wednesday morning at the Sirajganj Regional Passport Office. Muntakeem Md Ibrahim, assistant director and regional passport officer in Sirajganj, said, ‘In the morning, the youth came to apply for a passport identifying himself as Riaz Mia, 25, son of Gafur Mia from Ullapara of Sirajganj.’ ‘His behaviour and statements raised suspicion after which we questioned him in detail,’ Muntakeem said. During questioning, he eventually admitted that he was coming from the Kutupalong camp in Cox’s Bazar. Later about noon, he was handed over to the Sadar police, the officer further said. The Rohingya youth attempted to obtain a passport using a birth registration certificate issued by the Purnimagati Union Parishad under Ullapara upazila, said Muntakeem. ‘Our officers and employees remain alert so that Rohingyas cannot acquire Bangladeshi passports,’ he said. Sirajganj Sadar police officer-in-charge Mokhlesur Rahman said about 4:00pm that a case had been filed against the arrested Rohingya youth. How he was able to use an Ullapara address and manage to obtain a birth certificate from the Purnimagati UP would be investigated, said the OC. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as of October 31, 2025, Bangladesh was sheltering nearly 12 lakh Rohingyas, displaced from the Rakhine state of Myanmar, in the camps in Cox’s Bazar district.",

According to a Facebook post shared by Inter-Services Public Relations on its verified page on Friday, the operations were carried out between December 4 and 11 by different infantry divisions and independent brigades of the army, in coordination with police and other agencies. During the drives, the law enforcers recovered 10 illegal firearms, 12 rounds of ammunition, 12 crude bombs, various types of narcotics, and both local and foreign sharp weapons. The detainees have been handed over to local police stations for further action. Such drives by the Bangladesh Army will continue across the country to ensure public safety, according the ISPR. In addition to ensuring law and order, the army is assisting authorities in maintaining stability in industrial areas amid labour unrest. The army urged the public to report to the nearest army camp if any suspicious activity is noticed.",

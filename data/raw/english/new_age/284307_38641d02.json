They also demanded that the government refrain from leasing out container terminals of the country’s other ports to foreign operators. SKOP organised the rally in front of the National Press Club in the capital Dhaka, with labour leader Abdul Kader Hawlader in the chair. Jatiyabadi Sramik Dal president Anwar Hossain said that the government had already leased out the management of two container terminals of the country to foreign companies, which went against the national interests. The interim government was planning to lease out the New Mooring container terminal of the Chattogram port to a foreign company, he said. He called on the interim government to refrain from leasing out terminals of the ports to foreign companies.

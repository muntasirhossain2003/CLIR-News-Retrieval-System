For the first time in Bangladesh’s history, an officer cadet received the two prestigious honours simultaneously from among nearly 200 cadets representing 40 countries at the passing-out ceremony held in London. Princess Anne conferred the award, according to a social media post by the Bangladesh high commission in London. Rifat was adjudged the best-performing international cadet and received the International Sword of Honour for outstanding military performance, said the Inter-Services Public Relations in a separate press release on Saturday. He also secured third place overall in the course based on combined academic and military performance and ranked first among international cadets, for which he was awarded the International Award.

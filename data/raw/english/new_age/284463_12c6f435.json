    "title": "ACC launches inquiry against ex-Bangladesh president Abdul Hamid",
    "body": "The Anti-Corruption Commission has launched an inquiry over allegations of causing a loss of Tk 24 crore to the state through spending on decoration and beautification in Dhaka’s Nikunja-1 area and amassing illegal wealth against former Bangladesh president Abdul Hamid. The commission director general, prevention, Md Akhter Hossain on Sunday confirmed the launching of the inquiry against the former president over the graft allegations. He said the ACC never considers a person’s identity when opening an inquiry. The main issue is the objectivity of the allegations. A three-storey house belonging to Hamid stands on Plot 6 on Lake Drive Road in Dhaka’s Nikunja area. After completing his tenure as president, Abdul Hamid moved into the house with his family in April 2023. According to the allegations, the state suffered huge financial losses due to the construction of walk-in barriers on both sides of the house, decks and hanging bridges, and lamp posts along the canal adjacent to the property.",

    "body": "The police in Dhaka’s Ashulia area arrested four men early Thursday and recovered a foreign-made pistol following a shooting the previous night that allegedly stemmed from a turf dispute, officials said. A team from Dhaka District North Detective Branch arrested the suspects at about 4:30am on Thursday during raids at the Baipail and Kaichabari areas, hours after gunfight was reported in nearby Palashbari at about 9:30pm on Wednesday. The detainees were identified as Abdul Mannan Patwary, 24, of Chandpur, Monowar Hossain Titu, 28, of Manikganj, Al Amin Swapon, 30, and Julhas Mia, 30, of Palashbari area in Ashulia. DB officials said that the gunfight erupted over local dominance, prompting detectives to visit the scene, collect evidence and begin targeted operations. Based on information provided by Mannan Patwary, officers later recovered a foreign pistol with a magazine from a grove in the Nobartek area of Kaichabari. The police also said that Titu had previously served as a joint general secretary of the Ashulia unit of Awami League’s student wing, Bangladesh Chhatra League. Md Jalal Uddin, officer-in-charge of Dhaka district north DB, said that preparations were underway to file a regular case with Ashulia Police Station.",

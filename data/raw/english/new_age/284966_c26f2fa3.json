    "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party nominated Dhaka-8 constituency candidate Mirza Abbas was barred from visiting bullet-injured Inqilab Mancha spokesperson and independent contestant Sharif Osman Hadi at Dhaka Medical College Hospital on Friday afternoon. Hadi, who was admitted to the hospital with bullet injuries, is now in critical condition, according to doctors. Abbas arrived at the DMCH emergency gate around 4:00pm to see Hadi. As he attempted to enter, several agitated Inqilab Mancha activists rushed toward him, prompting army personnel present there to escort him inside safely. He left the hospital around 4:45pm but struggled to move through the heavy crowd gathered outside. Leaders and activists of Jubo Dal and Chhatra Dal eventually guided him to his vehicle, assisted by army members. Despite tensions, no major untoward incident occurred due to the presence of security personnel. Earlier, news of Abbas' visit drew hundreds of BNP activists to the hospital premises where many chanted slogans welcoming him. Hadi was shot earlier in the afternoon while traveling by rickshaw on Box Culvert Road in the capital’s Bijaynagar area. The police said an unidentified motorcyclist fired at him and fled. No one has been arrested yet.",

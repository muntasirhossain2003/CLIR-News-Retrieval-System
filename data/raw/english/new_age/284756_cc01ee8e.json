    "body": "The police on Wednesday arrested a woman, who was the main suspect in the case filed over murder of a woman and her daughter at Mohammadpur in Dhaka city. The woman, arrested in Jhalakathi, was identified as Ayesha Akhter, who had joined as a part-time help at the house four days before the killings committed on December 8. Laila Afroz, 48, and Nafisa Nawal Binte Aziz, 15, wife and daughter of school teacher Azizul Islam, were found killed inside their home on Shahjahan Road. Dhaka Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner for Tejgaon Division Ibne Mizan told New Age that the police primarily believed that the murders were carried out after the house help was caught stealing valuables from the house. ‘She will be interrogated thoroughly to determine whether there was any other motive behind the gruesome double murder and whether anyone else was involved,’ he said. The police, however, also detained Ayesha’s husband, Rabbi, for questioning, added the police official. Laila and Nafisa were killed while schoolteacher Azizul was at work. Azizul returned to the flat at about 11:00am to discover the bodies. He later filed a case naming Ayesha, who had joined the household only four days earlier, as the lone accused. Ayesha reportedly fled the flat with a mobile phone, a laptop, gold jewellery and cash. CCTV footage showed Ayesha entering the building around 7:51am wearing a burqa and leaving at 9:36am dressed in Nafisa’s school uniform with a bag hanging from her shoulder.",

    "body": "Bangladeshi theatre troupe Mad Theatre’s fourth production, titled ‘Ghore Phera’, narrates horrific tortures, mostly against women, during the country’s War of Independence in 1971. The monodrama, performed by actress Sonia Hassan, is based on fiction writer Mojaffor Hossain’s story of the same title. The play, written and directed by Asadul Islam, was staged on Tuesday at the ongoing Bijoy Boimela at the Bangla Academy in the capital. The play revolves around a woman’s struggle for survival during the War of Independence. Sonia Hassan portrays the character of a woman who lost her husband and child during the war. She also lost her tongue when she attempted to prevent rape in the torture cell. The torturers - the Pakistani occupation army and their collaborators - cut her tongue and belly. The play narrates her return journey from a camp to home, which was also burnt by the Pakistani marauding army. She also narrates what she witnessed on her return journey. The light was designed by Ashraful Islam and the background music of the play was also designed by the writer and director Asadul Islam. Ghore Phera premiered at the Parichay Utshab at Anulia Mahamaya Vidyamandir in the Indian state of West Bengal in March 2024.",

    "body": "Thirteen deputy commissioners of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police and 50 officers-in-charge of police stations under the DMP were reshuffled on Thursday. The transfers of the police officers within the city were made through two separate notices signed by DMP commissioner SM Sazzat Ali, before the national election slated for the first half of February 2026. Several senior officials of the police and home ministry said that the reshuffle was made through a lottery on the same day.

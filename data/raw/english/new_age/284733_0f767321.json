    "body": "Workers of a garment factory staged a demonstration in front of PN Composite Ltd at Ambagh in Konabari, Gazipur on Tuesday, protesting the sudden closure of the factory. ‘The authorities hung a closure notice on the main gate on Monday evening. When workers arrived for duty Tuesday morning and saw the notice, they immediately began protesting,’ said Khandaker Jalal Uddin, officer-in-charge of Konabari police station. According to workers, the unrest began after an employee left the factory on December 7 for urgent personal reasons. Upon his return, he engaged in a verbal altercation with several factory officials. On Monday, a group of workers demonstrated demanding the removal of some officials involved in the dispute. Despite repeated efforts by the factory management to calm the situation, tensions persisted throughout the day. After workers dispersed in the evening, the management decided to close the factory and placed the notice on the main gate. Industrial police and local law enforcement rushed to the spot upon receiving information and brought the situation under control. Workers eventually left the area at around 9:00am following assurances that production would resume next week. When contacted, factory manager Tapas said a misunderstanding had arisen between a worker and officials, prompting workers to stop work. Despite several attempts to resolve the issue, production remained disrupted on Monday, leading the authorities to temporarily shut down the factory.",

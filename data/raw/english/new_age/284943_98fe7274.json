    "body": "The application deadline for the Agricultural Cluster Admission Test has been extended to December 18, 2025, considering the overall convenience of applicants, while the previous deadline was 15 December. The decision was unanimously approved by a meeting of the cluster’s steering committee on Thursday, hosted by Gazipur Agricultural University, the lead institution for this year’s admission cycle under 2025–26 session. The meeting was chaired by GAU vice-chancellor Professor GKM Mustafizur Rahman where vice-chancellors of six cluster-member universities were present in person, and the vice-chancellors of three universities joined virtually. The discussion focused on making the application process more transparent, efficient and student-friendly. Key issues application verification, technical support, exam management and initiatives to ease students’ experience were reviewed and finalised. ‘Our students’ future is our highest priority. We extended the deadline to ensure everyone can apply smoothly,’ said Professor Rahman. The VC urged applicants to complete their submissions within the new timeframe and to follow the official Agricultural Cluster website (acas.edu.bd) for updates. The admission test for the nine public universities under the cluster will be held nationwide on Saturday, January 3, 2026, from 2:00pm to 3:00pm. This year, the cluster offers a total of 3,701 seats.",

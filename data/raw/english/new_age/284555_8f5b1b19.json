Locals and police said Mrityunjoy married two years ago after a love affair, but his in-laws never accepted the marriage and legal disputes followed, and he was eventually divorced by his wife under her family’s pressure, leaving him mentally distressed. Ariful Islam, controller of Arnab Hostel, said that most students had gone home after exams, leaving only three on the premises and as Mrityunjoy did not respond to repeated calls, Ariful broke a window and found him hanging.",

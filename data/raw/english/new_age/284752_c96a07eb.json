    "body": "A youth was hacked to death by unidentified assailants at Shibganj upazila in Chapainawabganj on Monday night. The deceased was Nayon Ali, 25, son of Abdul Karim of Babupur village under Nayalavanga union parishad in the upazila, police said. According to the locals and police, Nayon was attacked with sharp weapons at Babupur Mor in the evening, leaving deep injuries on both his legs and arms. Locals rescued him and took him to Chapainawabganj District Hospital from where doctors-in-charge referred him to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, but he died on the way, they said. Dr Shankar K Biswas, in-charge of RMCH emergency department, told New Age that Nayon was declared dead on arrival at the hospital at 8:10pm. ‘He died from excessive bleeding before arriving at the hospital,’ he added. According to the locals and the police, Nayon had links with Bangladesh Nationalist Party politics and was killed due to internal conflict. However, BNP’s Shibganj upazila unit convenor and former union parishad chairman Ashraful Islam said that the murder was not caused by any BNP internal conflict. ‘Nayon held no post in the BNP, he moved with whoever was in power,’ he said. ‘No case was lodged with the police station till Tuesday afternoon,’ Humayun Kabir, officer-in-charge of Shibganj police station said, adding that they were trying to arrest the killers and find the motive behind the killing.",

    "body": "A Dhaka metropolitan magistrate court on Monday sent Janata Party Bangladesh secretary general and National Press Club former president Shaukat Mahmood to jail in a case filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act. Metropolitan magistrate Jewel Rana passed the order after the investigation officer in the case and Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Detective Branch inspector for Raman zone, Akhtar Morshed, produced him before the court and sought its permission to take the journalist into police custody for 10 days for interrogation in the case. The court also set Thursday for hearing both petitions, one filed by the police and the other by Shaukat, said general recording officer for Ramna police station, sub-inspector Jinnat Ali. A team of DB arrested Shaukat at Malibagh in the capital on Sunday in connection with a case filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act. Shaukat, also an expelled Bangladesh Nationalist Party vice-chairman, was shown arrested in the anti-terrorism case filed with Ramna police station on September 14 against Bangladesh-origin US national Enayet Karim Chowdhury. Shaukat was not named in the case, said the police, adding that investigators, during the probe, found his involvement with the case against Enayet. Police on September 13 arrested Enayet at Minto Road in Dhaka for his suspicious movements and suspected conspiracy to overthrow the interim government.

On March 21, 2023, the BNP expelled Shaukat from all posts allegedly for violating party discipline.",

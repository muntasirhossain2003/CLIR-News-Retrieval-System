    "body": "Industries adviser Adilur Rahman Khan on Friday said that the country would not import sugar if adequate stocks were available in domestic warehouses. ‘State-owned sugar mills can become profitable again through modernisation, cultivation of improved sugarcane varieties, and adoption of modern farming techniques, product diversification, and good governance. If sufficient domestically produced sugar is stocked, there will be no need for imports,’ he said. Adilur made the remarks while addressing the inaugural ceremony of the 88th sugarcane crushing season of Carew and Company (Bangladesh) Ltd at Darshana. Highlighting Carew and Company as a traditional state-owned industrial entity, he said, ‘The organisation contributes significantly to the national economy by producing sugar, spirit, vinegar, organic fertiliser and other products.’ Speaking as a special guest, Khulna range DIG Md Rezaul Haque stressed that the dedicated efforts of farmers and workers were essential to expand the company and boost production. Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation chairman Rashidul Hasan, deputy commissioner Mohammad Kamal Hossain, superintendent of police Mohammad Monirul Islam, Carew managing director Rabbik Hasan, sugarcane growers, mill officials, employees and labour leaders were present at the event, said a ministry press release. Crest awards were also presented to the best sugarcane growers. For the 2025-26 crushing season, Carew and Company has set a target to process 76,000 tonnes of sugarcane and produce 4,256 tonnes of sugar.",

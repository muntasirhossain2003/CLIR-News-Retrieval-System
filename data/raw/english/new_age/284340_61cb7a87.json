    "body": "The planned medical transfer of Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia to London for advanced treatment might be pushed back once more, according to party leaders. Initially, the BNP had scheduled her departure for December 5 on an air ambulance from Qatar. However, the aircraft failed to arrive due to technical issues, prompting the party to announce a revised plan for December 7. To facilitate the transfer, the Qatari authorities had arranged to hire a German air ambulance, party sources said. BNP insiders confirmed that Khaleda Zia would not be travelling on December 7 either. Her medical transfer might take place after December 9 or 10. A senior party source said the plan to send Khaleda Zia abroad has been deferred to December 9, taking her current health condition into account. However, the final decision will depend on her medical condition and the advice of her doctors. As of Saturday morning, no improvement in her health status had been reported, and her condition remained unchanged. Khaleda Zia is currently receiving treatment at Evercare Hospital in Dhaka, where she has been admitted with multiple long-standing health complications.",

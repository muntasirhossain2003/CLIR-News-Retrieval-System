    "body": "A Dhaka court today placed house help Ayesha on a six-day remand in the case filed over Tuesday's double murder in Mohammadpur. Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Mahbub Alam passed the order after police sought a 10-day remand, a court staffer said. The court also placed Ayesha's husband, Rabbi, on a three-day remand in the same case. The couple was arrested yesterday in Nalchity upazila of Jhalakathi. Police said Ayesha had planned to steal valuables from the Mohammadpur home and, after working there for three days, carried a sharp knife with the intention of using it if anyone noticed. Upon arriving at the flat on Shahjahan Road early Monday, she allegedly went to the kitchen, took another knife, and kept both with her. When her employer, Laila Afroz, 48, saw her stealing, Ayesha allegedly stabbed her indiscriminately using the two knives. As Laila's daughter, Nafisa Nawal Binte Aziz, 15, attempted to save her mother, she too was stabbed. Laila and Nafisa, wife and daughter of school teacher AZM Azizul Islam, were murdered inside their home while Azizul was at work in Uttara. Azizul later filed a case naming Ayesha as the sole accused. Police said Ayesha fled the scene with a mobile phone, a laptop, gold ornaments, and cash. The stolen gold items included a chain and earrings belonging to Laila, who was stabbed at least 30 times. Nafisa suffered at least six stab wounds.",

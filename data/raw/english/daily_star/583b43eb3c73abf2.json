    "body": "BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman will return to Bangladesh \"very soon\", and his arrival will mark a turning point for the country, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said today. Speaking at the party's event titled \"Plan for Building the Country\" this morning, Fakhrul said, \"Since all our leaders are present here today, I want to inform you that our leader will be with us very soon.\" \"The day our leader steps onto Bangladesh soil, the entire country should feel his presence. Remember this… can you? That day, we aim to change the face of Bangladesh,\" he said. \"We want to move forward, we want to progress. We strive to establish Bangladesh as a respected nation, and to fulfil our leader's vision, we must move ahead.\" Fakhrul described the upcoming election as a \"struggle for victory\". \"The fight now is for us to win this election. We must secure a complete victory to move Bangladesh forward,\" he said. Fakhrul accused certain groups of misusing religion to mislead the public. \"Today, there are two battles we face: one is to place Bangladesh in a politically and economically strong position, and the other is to defeat these evil forces. These are the two struggles you must focus on. We always practise positive politics, and we always think ahead.\"",

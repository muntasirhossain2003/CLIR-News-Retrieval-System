    "body": "Ukrainian aerial drones struck a Russian oil platform in the Caspian Sea for the first time yesterday, halting production at the facility owned by Lukoil, according to an official from Ukraine's Security Service. The attack on the Filanovsky rig - part of Russia's largest Caspian oil field - is the latest sign that Ukraine is trying to step up its campaign to disrupt Russian oil and gas output, reports Reuters. At least four drone strikes hit the platform, forcing extraction to stop at more than 20 oil and gas wells, the official said. Meanwhile, Russia shot down nearly 300 Ukrainian drones overnight, one of Kyiv's largest attempted attacks of the four-year war and a barrage that forced Moscow airports to temporarily close, Russian officials said yesterday.",

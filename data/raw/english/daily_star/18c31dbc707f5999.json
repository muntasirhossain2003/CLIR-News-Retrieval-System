    "body": "A Dhaka court today placed Mohammad Kabir, a close associate of prime accused Faisal Karim Masud, on a seven-day remand in a case filed over the shooting of Inqilab Moncho spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi. Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Hasibuzzaman passed the order after the Detective Branch (DB) of police produced Kabir before the court with a 10-day remand prayer, a court staffer said. Kabir was arrested yesterday from the Baktabali area of Fatullah in Narayanganj. Hadi, an independent aspiring candidate for the Dhaka-8 constituency, was shot in Dhaka's Paltan area on December 12 while campaigning. On December 14, Inqilab Moncho's Member Secretary Abdullah Al Jaber filed an attempted murder case with Paltan Model Police Station against Faisal and several unnamed individuals in this regard. Yesterday, Faisal's wife Saheda Parvin Samia, his brother-in-law Wahid Ahmed Shipu, and his friend Maria Akter Lima were each placed on a five-day remand in the case.",

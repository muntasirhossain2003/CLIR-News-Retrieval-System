    "body": "The Ministry of Civil Aviation has sought an explanation from Saimon Overseas Ltd, a leading travel agency, over alleged money laundering through cross-border air ticket sales. The ministry issued a letter recently in December, saying that, based on a ticket sales statement reviewed by officials, Saimon Overseas allegedly sold total 1,894 air tickets worth around Tk 16 crore through foreign travel agents between January 4, 2024 and August 21 this year, using its IATA number 42300230 and associated GDS ID. The tickets were sold in Malaysia, Australia, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and various European countries, according to the allegation. Passengers used these tickets to travel to Bangladesh or onward to third countries, but the payments were allegedly made abroad and were not repatriated to Bangladesh, reads the notice. The ministry attached relevant documents and asked the agency to provide clarification within three working days. Connected, Afsia Jannat Saleh, managing director of Saimon Overseas, told The Daily Star that the allegations are totally \"baseless\" and \"false\". She said those who were involved in an illegal ticket syndicate, including Naria Travels, provided such imaginary allegations to the ministry to malign their reputation. \"We are doing our business following the rules and laws of the land,\" she also said, adding, \"We have submitted our reply to the ministry, and they are investigating the matter.\"",

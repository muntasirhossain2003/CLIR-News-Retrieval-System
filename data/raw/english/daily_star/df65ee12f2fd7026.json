The victim, Lipi Akter, 35, was the wife of ASI Mohor Uddin, who serves with Rab-2 in Dhaka's Mohammadpur. Quoting the couple's daughter, Sarishabari Police Station Officer-in-Charge Mohammad Bachchu Mia said a group of thieves entered the house after breaking the grill of the veranda in the middle of the night. When Lipi saw them, they allegedly strangled her with a scarf, leaving her dead. Afterwards, the couple's daughter, Mithi Akter, a fifth grader, phoned her maternal uncle and informed him about the incident. Upon receiving the call, family members rushed to the house and took Lipi to Sarishabari Health Complex, where the on-duty doctor declared her dead. Police recovered the body around 11:30am and said they were preparing to send it for autopsy.",

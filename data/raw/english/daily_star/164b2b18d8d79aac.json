    "body": "A procession that began in front of the Ducsu building on the Dhaka University campus is heading towards the home adviser's office this afternoon. Ducsu Vice-President Abu Shadik Kayem, Assistant General Secretary Mohiuddin Khan, Literary and Cultural Affairs Secretary Musaddiq Ali Ibne Mohammad, Social Welfare Secretary AB Zubair, and leaders from several hall unions joined the procession. The protest follows a call issued last night by Shadik Kayem, demanding the arrest of those involved in Osman Hadi's shooting, nationwide drives to recover illegal arms, and the apprehension of what he described as \"Awami League-backed militants\". Although the programme was scheduled to begin at 12:00pm, protesters continued chanting slogans against the home adviser in front of the Ducsu building until around 12:40pm as the crowd grew. As of 1:30pm, the procession had reached the road near the Secretariat.",

    "body": "Bangladesh Chhatra Union's Dhaka University unit launched a four-day special programme yesterday at the Teacher-Student Centre of DU, marking the 1971 Liberation War. Titled \"Rokter Dolil\", the event opened with four exhibitions and a cultural evening, \"Muktir Gaan\" (Songs of Liberation). It will run until December 16. Shimul Kumbhakar, general secretary of a faction of Chhatra Union, said one of the exhibitions, \"Razakarer Amolnama\", features various articles published in the Daily Sangram. Another, \"Bijoy Gatha\", highlights the nation's victory in the Liberation War. The exhibition, \"Opurno Gonojuddho\", portrays the struggles people faced even after independence, while \"Jara Chilen Jara Achen\" focuses on the left-leaning intellectuals martyred on December 14, 1971. The remaining arrangement, \"Gonohottar Sakkho\", documents both the mass killings carried out by the Pakistani Army and the struggles of women during the war. Meghmallar Bosu, president of the DU unit of the Chhatra Union, said the Awami League \"monopolised\" the Liberation War narrative during its rule, erasing its \"people's war character\". He said the anti-liberation forces have been attempting to \"diminish the war's significance since the July uprising\". \"We organised this event primarily to counter these intellectual distortions. Through meticulous research, we've brought forward the reality of the people's war. We've also highlighted the genocide and exposed how Razakars manufactured consent for genocide,\" he said. Regarding the event, Maeen Ahmed, general secretary of the unit, said this year's victory month holds special significance as an \"organised group has been questioning the Liberation War since the July uprising\". \"We see this time as both a crisis and an opportunity full of possibilities,\" he added.",

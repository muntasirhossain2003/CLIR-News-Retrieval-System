    "title": "Caretaker govt system and judicial independence 'irreversible': Asif Nazrul",
    "body": "Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Adviser Prof Asif Nazrul today expressed confidence that the caretaker government system and the independence of the judiciary will remain intact regardless of who forms the next government after the interim administration. Speaking at an event marking Human Rights Day 2025 at InterContinental Dhaka on Wednesday, Nazrul said these two reforms are \"protected and irreversible.\" He explained that the caretaker government system is safeguarded by a Supreme Court verdict, while the Supreme Court Secretariat Ordinance is upheld by the court itself. \"These two factors are the basic guarantees for advancing human rights,\" he noted. Nazrul also cited the Police Commission Ordinance as an example, saying that while a fully empowered commission could not be formed, it would still function independently and exert positive pressure on the government. He urged all stakeholders to safeguard the reforms achieved so far, stressing that Bangladesh can move forward if everyone works together. Housing and Industries Adviser Adilur Rahman Khan and Environment, Forest and Climate Change Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan also addressed the event.",

    "title": "Finance adviser confined at Secretariat for over 5 hours",
    "body": "Employees of various ministries and departments staged a protest at the Bangladesh Secretariat yesterday, demanding a 20 percent allowance for Secretariat staff, during which they confined Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed. According to witnesses, around 2:30pm, 150-200 non-cadre staff gathered in front of the office of Salehuddin. He was confined for about five and a half hours. As the employees did not move even after being repeatedly told to do so, around 7:30pm, police personnel stationed at the Secretariat were called in. The police dispersed the protesters. Earlier, during the protest, some employees urged the government to issue a gazette by meeting their demand yesterday. They noted that the schedule for the national election will be announced today and expressed concern that their demand might not be met afterwards. They added that they have long been demanding this allowance. In March this year, the Bangladesh Government Workers' Demand Realisation Unity Council submitted an application to the finance ministry, stating that officials and employees working at the Secretariat perform government duties efficiently, often working beyond office hours and on holidays, yet do not receive any additional financial benefits such as rations or a Secretariat allowance.",

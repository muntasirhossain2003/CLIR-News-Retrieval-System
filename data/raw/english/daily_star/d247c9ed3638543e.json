    "body": "During the Liberation War, indigenous people scattered across different parts of the country displayed extraordinary bravery. Just as indigenous men took part in the fighting, indigenous women also risked their lives to deliver supplies, ammunition, and weapons to the Mukti Bahini camps. Shoulder to shoulder, some of them even joined the frontlines. One such indigenous woman was Kankan Heninchita. She was one of the three women awarded the title Bir Protik in recognition of their bravery during the Liberation War. She was the only indigenous woman to receive this gallantry award. During the Liberation War, this seemingly ordinary woman became a fearless spy. Her secret information enabled the Mukti Bahini to carry out daring operations, and she even stole weapons and ammunition from Pakistani camps to supply the freedom fighters. Accounts of Kankan's heroism are found in several books. Notable among them are 'Muktijuddhe Adibashi' by Ayub Hossain and Charu Haque; 'Adibashi Muktijoddha' by Tapan Kumer Dey, 'Muktijuddhe Nritattik Goshthi Ebong Bangladesher Shadhinota Sangram' by Ayub Hossain; and 'Nari Muktijoddha' (Volume One) by Meherunnesa Mary. Sources reveal that Kankan was born into an indigenous Khasi family. She lost her father before birth and her mother at just a year and a half old. After her grandmother's passing, she was raised by her elder sister. She later married Shahid Uddin. Their first child died within a year, and five more children also died shortly after birth. Because of this, Kankan faced social humiliation. While pregnant with a daughter, her husband divorced her, and she returned to live with her sister. Near her sister's in-laws' home was a Pakistani border guard camp. In early 1971, Kankan married a non-Bengali guard named Majid Khan. During the war, Kankan's husband was transferred without informing her. Later, her sister and brother-in-law were martyred by Pakistani forces. While searching for her husband from camp to camp, Kankan aroused suspicion and was detained by the Pakistanis as a suspected Mukti Bahini spy. Under the pretext of interrogation, she was brutally tortured for a week, including being burned with red-hot iron rods. Kankan repeatedly said she was only searching for her husband, not spying. Eventually she was brought before a Pakistani major, who, after asking about her husband, realised she was telling the truth. At that point, the Pakistani forces decided to recruit Kankan as their own spy. Remembering the torture she had suffered, Kankan agreed. She was given a paper to show if caught by the Pakistanis, but never to open before the Mukti Bahini, as it identified her as their agent. Disguised as a beggar, she was sent from village to village to gather information on the freedom fighters. A fire of vengeance burned within Kankan. She made contact with Captain Helal Uddin, commander of the Lakshmipur camp, and revealed everything to him. The freedom fighters recognised that this was a unique opportunity. Since this woman had unrestricted access to Pakistani camps, she could be used to gather intelligence against them. Thus, Kankan became a spy for the freedom fighters. In the early days, along with collecting intelligence, Kankan supplied food and weapons to the Shaheed Company of the Lakshmipur camp. Taking advantage of the trust placed in her, she repeatedly stole weapons and ammunition from the Pakistanis and delivered them to the Mukti Bahini camps. In August, freedom fighters decided to carry out an operation to destroy the Jardiya Bridge in Sunamganj; the mission was extremely risky. Kankan herself transported ammunition and mines to the operation site on a raft made of banana trunks. Using the bombs and explosives she carried, the Jardiya Bridge was successfully destroyed. Based on the intelligence she provided, freedom fighters in the region planned and executed their attacks. With Kankan's extraordinary assistance, the Mukti Bahini conducted at least 20 successful battles, including the battles of Basrai Tengra Tila in Sunamganj, Betirgaon, Nurpur, Teblai, Mohabbatpur, and Silairpar. Kankan also directly took part in frontline combat in nine battles, including those at Tengra Tila, Banglabazar, Durbin Tila, and Andhar Tila. While fighting on the frontlines at Tengra Tila, she was wounded by a bullet. For her unforgettable contributions to the Liberation War, the government awarded Kankan Heninchita the gallantry title of Bir Protik. On March 21, 2018, the freedom fighter breathed her last.",

DMP issued a press release on Tuesday following a double murder in Dhaka's Mohammadpur area on Monday, where a domestic worker was allegedly involved in the killing of two people. The DMP chief stressed that such crimes can often be prevented if residents exercise caution. He requested to collect and keep a copy of the worker's national identity card, a recently taken passport-size photograph, and the names and addresses of at least two identifiers to confirm their identity. The DMP commissioner also reiterated the importance of properly filling out tenant registration forms and cooperating with police in gathering citizen information.",

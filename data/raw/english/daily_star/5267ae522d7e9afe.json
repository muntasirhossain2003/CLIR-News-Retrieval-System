    "body": "Bangladesh and India yesterday completed the mutual repatriation of 32 Bangladeshi and 47 Indian fishermen who had been detained for maritime boundary violations earlier this year. According to a press release, under Coast Guard supervision, 47 Indian fishermen and three fishing boats were handed over to the Indian Coast Guard at the Bangladesh-India International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). At the same time, Bangladesh received 32 fishermen and two fishing boats, including FB Mayer Doa, while the process of receiving another boat continues. The Bangladesh Navy had detained five Indian fishing boats and 47 fishermen on July 12 and August 2, 2025, for fishing illegally within Bangladesh waters near the maritime boundary. The Indian Coast Guard, meanwhile, detained two Bangladeshi fishing boats and 32 fishermen on September 12 and 17, accusing them of crossing into Indian waters, a Coast Guard official said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitated a tripartite agreement to enable the exchange, with the Bangladesh Coast Guard assigned to conduct the handover and reception. The Bangladeshi fishermen and their boats were reunited with their families at the Coast Guard Base in Mongla today, he added.",

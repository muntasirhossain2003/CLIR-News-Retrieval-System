    "body": "Tobacco consumption cost in Bangladesh was Tk 87,000 crore last year, more than double the tax collected from tobacco companies in the 2023-24 fiscal year, according to a recent Dhaka University study. Among the costs, health-related expenses totalled around Tk 73,000 crore while environmental costs stood at Tk 14,500 crore, the study shows. The Institute of Health Economics of DU carried out the study in association with Economics for Health and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Ashraful Kibria, one of the authors of the study, revealed the findings at a programme organised by the Power and Participation Research Center at the PPRC Dhanmondi office in Dhaka today. The country earned around Tk 40,000 crore in revenue from tobacco companies in the 2023-2024 fiscal year. Meanwhile, another study discussed at the same programme, showed that 69.4 percent of shops within 100 metres of schools advertise tobacco products. About 20 percent of sales were engaged in promotional activities of tobacco products. PPRC came out with the findings upon surveying 666 points of sale near 121 schools in four divisions last month. Mohammad Ihtesham Hassan, senior research associate of PPRC, read out the findings. The study found 84 percent of points of sale, selling flavoured cigarettes, and 99 percent were selling single sticks. The organisation recommended a comprehensive ban on point-of-sale advertising and promotion of tobacco products. It also suggested banning flavoured cigarettes and prohibiting sale of single sticks to reduce the affordability and appeal of tobacco products among youths.",

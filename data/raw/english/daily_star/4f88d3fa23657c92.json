    "body": "BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman yesterday called upon everyone to come forward in the journey to establish true democracy while protecting human rights. He made the call in a message posted on his verified Facebook page on the eve of Human Rights Day, which will be observed today. Tarique Rahman said the theme of Human Rights Day 2025 is \"Human Rights, Our Everyday Essentials.\" With this year's theme in focus, he expressed deep solidarity with the oppressed people around the world who have lost their fundamental rights. \"At the same time, I affirm that -- whether in Bangladesh or anywhere else on earth --no one should ever again be deprived of basic human rights. For that, the protection of human rights must be an essential part of our everyday practice,\" he said. He further said the country has endured a dark chapter of fascist misrule for more than a decade and a half, during which human rights were buried. Democracy was obliterated, and the state apparatus was gripped firmly in the hands of an authoritarian clique, he said. \"Today, we stand on a new journey -- a journey to restore democracy and safeguard human rights. Our future state must be one where human rights remain protected. Poverty is now viewed globally as one of the most serious human rights challenges. Eradicating poverty is an attainable goal in establishing human rights,\" he added. \"At this moment, people of the country are united in their commitment to protecting human rights. Everyone must come forward in this journey of establishing true democracy while protecting human rights. This should be our firm commitment on the universal Human Rights Day,\" he said.",

The restriction was imposed on Tuesday afternoon by Ajmiriganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) and Executive Magistrate SM Rezaul Karim. According to the order, the ban will remain in effect from 1:00 pm Tuesday to 1:00 pm Wednesday. Police and local sources said tension had been brewing for days between supporters of Hannan Mia of Kumedpur in Kakailche and those of Al Quran Saudagar of Sarkar Hati over establishing dominance in the area. On Monday evening, the two sides clashed violently at Kakailche Bazar, leaving at least 20 people injured. Several shops were vandalised and looted during the incident, locals reported. Fresh violence broke out again around 8:00 am Tuesday when both groups attacked each other with locally made weapons. A man named Russell Mia, 45, was critically injured and taken to Ajmiriganj Upazila Health Complex, where doctors declared him dead. The UNO said the restrictions were imposed to maintain law and order in the area. He added that the duration of the order may be extended depending on the situation.",

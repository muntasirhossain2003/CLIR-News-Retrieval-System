    "body": "A rare Himalayan griffon vulture was rescued in the Amlapara area of Sirajganj municipality yesterday. According to local sources, the vulture was found near the Jamuna river by a local resident, Pappu Sheikh. Pappu said the bird was unable to fly, prompting some young men from neighbouring shoal areas to catch it and keep it confined. Mamun Biswas, chairman of Bird Safety House, said they later rescued the vulture from the house. \"The vulture fell to the ground due to exhaustion after flying a long distance. We are providing it with food and medicine,\" Mamun said. He added that officials of the Bangladesh Biodiversity Conservation Federation and the Rajshahi divisional office of Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation have been informed. \"We will take steps according to their directions,\" he said.",

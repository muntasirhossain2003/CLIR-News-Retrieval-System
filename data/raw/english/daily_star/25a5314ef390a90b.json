DMCH Director Brig Gen Md Asaduzzaman confirmed the development. Police and witnesses said Hadi was heading towards Bijoynagar on a rickshaw around 2:25pm.

In a Facebook post at 11:52 am today, Hadi wrote, \"Since I don't have any posters or festoons in Dhaka-8, there's no pressure of them being torn down either. Jumma Mubarak from in front of the ACC.\" Hadi announced his candidacy in a Facebook post on September 14. His platform -- Inqilab Moncho -- was formed on August 13 last year.",

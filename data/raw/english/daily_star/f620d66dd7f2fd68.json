    "body": "A new graffiti from the iconic Subodh series has quietly emerged on a wall in Agargaon, Dhaka. The timing feels anything but accidental. As Bangladesh commemorates its hard-won freedom on Victory Day, the return of Subodh has reignited reflection and a sense of unfinished conversation between past and present. The location adds another layer of meaning: Agargaon is where Subodh first appeared in 2017. Subodh was last seen on August 5, 2024, at the Dhaka University Metro Station. This re-emergence in Agargaon seems to trace a full circle, reconnecting the present moment with the origins of the series. In the latest mural, Subodh is a soldier of art. His weapon is not a rifle, but a bundle of paintbrushes and spray cans. He kneels gently before a little girl holding the Bangladesh flag, kissing her forehead in a tender gesture of protection and hope. His military helmet rests softly on her head. The image transforms the familiar symbol of the soldier into something deeply human -- an artist, a guardian, a witness. It reinforces a recurring theme that runs through the Subodh series: resistance through compassion, creativity, and care, rather than violence. With this latest appearance, HOBEKI? once again lets the wall speak on a day when the nation remembers what freedom costs, and what it must continue to protect.",

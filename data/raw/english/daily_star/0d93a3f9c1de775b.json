    "body": "Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado is doing well, a spokesperson for the Venezuelan opposition leader said on Wednesday, despite sustaining an injury to her back during her recent flight from Venezuela. Machado fractured a vertebra while fleeing her home country on a small boat last week to receive the award in Oslo. The laureate \"is doing well and is currently attending medical appointments with a specialist to ensure her prompt and full recovery,\" a spokesperson said in a statement on X. \"She is no longer in Oslo,\" he added. He did not say where she was. Machado went to Norway in defiance of a decade-long travel ban imposed by authorities in Venezuela and after spending more than a year in hiding, but she arrived too late for the official prize ceremony last week.",

    "body": "The nation yesterday observed Martyred Intellectuals Day, paying tribute to the eminent citizens who were brutally killed during the 1971 Liberation War. On December 14, 1971, the Pakistan army and its local collaborators abducted and murdered leading academics, writers, journalists, doctors and professionals in an apparent bid to cripple the intellectual backbone of the emerging nation, just days before Bangladesh achieved independence. The government and various political, social and cultural organisations marked the day with programmes across the country. Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus paid tribute by placing a wreath at the Martyred Intellectuals Memorial in Mirpur around 7:20am and observed a minute of silence. A contingent of the Bangladesh Armed Forces offered a state salute as the bugle sounded. Earlier, around 7:00am, President Mohammed Shahabuddin placed a wreath at the memorial to pay his respects. After the state observances, the memorial was opened to the public, with leaders of various political parties, professional bodies and socio-cultural organisations paying tribute in turn. BNP leaders, led by Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, laid wreaths at the memorial. Speaking to reporters, Fakhrul said that as the nation strives to build a democratic Bangladesh, hostile forces are once again engaging in violence and killings to obstruct the country's democratic journey. National Citizen Party leaders, led by its Convener Nahid Islam, also paid tribute. Nahid said the systematic killing of pro-Liberation War intellectuals on December 14, 1971, was aimed at preventing Bangladesh from standing on its own feet. Leaders of Gano Forum, Nagorik Oikya, Communist Party of Bangladesh, Gono Odhikar Parishad, Bhasani Janashakti Party, Biplabi Workers Party, BASAD (Marxist), Amar Bangladesh Party and Ganosamhati Andolon were among those who paid homage. Meanwhile, people from all walks of life gathered at the Rayerbazar Martyred Intellectuals Memorial in the capital from early morning. Freedom fighters, Dhaka University authorities, members of the Dhaka University Central Students' Union, students from various hall unions, Dhaka College, Dhaka Commerce College, Residential Model College and other educational institutions, along with political and voluntary organisations, paid tribute throughout the morning. Former youth and sports adviser Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain also paid homage. The BSS reported that district administrations organised programmes nationwide to observe the day, while student unions of Jahangirnagar University, Rajshahi University, Chittagong University and several colleges also paid tribute. Dhaka University authorities removed caricatures of war criminals painted on campus roads by students of Jagannath Hall. The artwork, created under a programme titled \"Tuli'r Achore Droho\" (Defiance Through Brushstrokes) on Saturday night, depicted Matiur Rahman Nizami, Ghulam Azam and Abdul Quader Mollah. The caricatures were erased yesterday following instructions from the university administration.",

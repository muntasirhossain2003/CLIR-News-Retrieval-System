    "body": "Bulgaria's prime minister announced yesterday that his government was resigning after less than a year in office following a series of anti-corruption protests. Jeliazkov's announcement came just ahead of a vote in parliament on a no-confidence motion against the government that the opposition had filed. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets across Bulgaria on Wednesday to protest against the government and corruption in the latest rally since the end of last month. The demonstrations were sparked by a 2026 draft budget, which protesters branded as an attempt to mask rampant corruption. The government withdrew the budget last week, but anger has persisted.",

    "body": "The Election Commission (EC) has reversed its earlier decision to exclude private bank officials from panels of polling officers for the upcoming polls and referendum, saying such personnel may now be appointed -- after due scrutiny -- if an adequate number of officials cannot be found elsewhere. In line with the revised decision, the EC has instructed the authorities concerned to prepare panels of polling officials by December 18, extending the initial deadline that ended today. Ahead of the upcoming 13th national election and referendum scheduled to be held on February 12 next year, the EC issued a letter in this regard on December 10, signed by EC Deputy Secretary Mohammad Monir Hossain. It said, for the 13th national parliamentary election, the Election Commission (EC) had decided to form panels of polling officials excluding officers and employees working in private banks. Meanwhile, the EC today issued a separate letter instructing its divisional, regional, and district offices that if polling officials cannot be arranged from the concerned upazila, officials may be appointed from the neighbouring or the nearest upazilas within the district.",

    "body": "A reel-making competition has been launched on social media, marking the homecoming of BNP acting chairman, Tarique Rahman. The competition, titled \"Bangladesh in My Thoughts,\" has been organised by the BNP, with 11 themes set for participants. Announcing the programme in Gulshan this afternoon, Tarique Rahman's adviser, Mahdi Amin, said 10 participants would get the opportunity to have a one-on-one interaction with the party's acting chairman at a special event. The themes include family card, farmer card, employment, education, environment, and sports, among others. People of any age, living at home or abroad, can take part by making a one-minute reel and posting it to the designated event on BNP's Facebook page. Mahdi Amin said winners would be selected based on 30 percent public voting and 70 percent jury board evaluation. The programme aims to reflect the thoughts and expectations of people of all ages, particularly the younger generation, he added. Mahdi Amin expressed hope that the competition would create an opportunity to share visions and ideas about the future of Bangladesh through social media.",

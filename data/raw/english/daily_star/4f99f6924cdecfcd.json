    "body": "Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has expressed deep concern over the shooting of Sharif Osman Hadi, spokesperson of Inquilab Moncho and a prospective independent candidate for Dhaka-8. Calling the incident \"completely unacceptable and extremely unfortunate for the country's peaceful political environment,\" Yunus directed authorities to ensure the highest level of medical care for Hadi. He instructed the health ministry to closely monitor the treatment process. At the same time, the chief adviser ordered law-enforcement agencies to carry out a swift and extensive investigation to identify those involved. He asked them to collect evidence from the scene, gather eyewitness accounts, review CCTV footage, and determine whether the attack was part of an organised plan. \"The government will not tolerate any form of violence aimed at disrupting the election,\" Yunus said. \"It is our responsibility to ensure public safety and the free movement of candidates. Whoever is responsible will be brought to justice.\" He also urged political parties, activists, supporters, and citizens to maintain peace and restraint so that the upcoming election can be held in a participatory, secure, and peaceful environment.",

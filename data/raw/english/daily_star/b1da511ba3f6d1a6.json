    "body": "BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia remains in critical condition in the intensive care unit of Evercare Hospital in Dhaka, where she has been receiving treatment for the past 20 days. The BNP Media Cell said last night that her condition stays unchanged. The former PM has been placed on \"elective ventilator support\" to help rest her lungs and other organs, according to her doctors on Thursday. Khaleda has developed several additional complications, including ineffective endocarditis, acute pancreatitis, and severe bacterial and fungal infections. On Thursday, her medical board confirmed that she is also undergoing regular dialysis due to kidney dysfunction. Doctors diagnosed acute pancreatitis on November 27, and treatment for it is ongoing. Khaleda, 80, has long been battling multiple health complications, including liver cirrhosis, arthritis, diabetes, and chronic issues affecting her kidneys, lungs, heart, and eyes. She was admitted to the hospital on November 23 on the advice of her medical board after being diagnosed with infections in her heart and lungs. Her treatment has been administered according to the guidelines recommended by both local and foreign doctors, the doctors said. Dr Zubaida Rahman, wife of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, arrived in Dhaka on December 5 to oversee her treatment.",

    "body": "Global watchdog CIVICUS Monitor has once again classified Bangladesh's civic space as \"repressed\", maintaining the same rating as last year. Bangladesh's status had been upgraded to \"repressed\" from \"closed\", the lowest category, in 2023. Even so, the country was cited as a \"bright spot\", with CIVICUS noting the resilience of civil society in defending civic freedoms. \"Since its 2024 political transition, when mass protests forced a change of government, Bangladesh has taken notable steps toward accountability and human rights reform,\" the Johannesburg-based organisation said in its report yesterday. The watchdog, which tracks civic space worldwide, also categorised India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan as \"repressed\", though India and Sri Lanka scored higher than Bangladesh. Maldives, Nepal, and Bhutan were assessed as having \"obstructed\" civic space, one step above \"repressed\", while Myanmar remained \"closed\". CIVICUS praised Bangladesh's interim authorities for inviting the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to conduct an independent fact-finding mission into violations committed during the former government's crackdown on the 2024 protests. The mission's report was released in February 2025. \"The government also established six reform commissions, including a Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The government has approved an ordinance to address disappearances. Courts have begun dropping cases against human rights defenders, marking early signs of progress despite ongoing tensions and reports of violence,\" the report stated. The CIVICUS Monitor evaluates conditions in each country using data from national civil society activists, regional research partners, international human rights indices, and its own in-house analysts. These findings are then synthesised to assign ratings ranging from \"open\", \"narrowed\", \"obstructed\", \"repressed\", to \"closed\".",

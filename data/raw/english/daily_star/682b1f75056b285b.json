    "body": "An 80-year-old woman was burnt to death early today after a fire broke out at her bedroom in Shariatpur Sadar upazila. The deceased was identified as Kamrun Nahar, wife of late Moslem Sardar, a resident of Rudrakar area, Palong Model Police Station's Officer-in-charge Shah Alam told The Daily Star. The incident occurred around 4:00am when the woman was asleep on her bed. She lived alone in the house, as her only daughter resides elsewhere after marriage. By the time police and fire service personnel arrived, local residents had mostly contained the fire. Police later recovered Kamrun Nahar's charred body from the bed. An earthen pot containing burning coal was found on the bed next to the body, the OC said. To stay warm during the night, the woman had placed the pot on the bed before going to sleep. Preliminary investigation indicates that the burning coal fell onto the bed, sparking the fire, he added. The body was sent to Shariatpur Sadar Hospital for autopsy. Police said an unnatural death case will be filed in connection with the incident. After completion of legal formalities, the body will be handed over to her daughter.",

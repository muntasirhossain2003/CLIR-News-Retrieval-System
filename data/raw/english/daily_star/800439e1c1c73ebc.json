We will not take part if the majority of the country's people are left out of the election,\" he said. Kader Siddique was speaking at a rally organised by Krishak Sramik Janata League at Shaheed Smriti Municipal Park in Tangail district town today. He also claimed that fewer than 20 percent voters may go to the polling stations, if the election is held in participation with only BNP, Jamaat and NCP.

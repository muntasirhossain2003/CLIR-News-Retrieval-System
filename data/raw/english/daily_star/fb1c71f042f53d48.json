    "body": "Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain has announced that he will contest the upcoming 13th National Parliamentary Election as an independent candidate from Dhaka-10 constituency. He made the announcement in a post on his verified Facebook page at 11:51 am today. After the announcement, he sought everyone's cooperation and support in a video message, saying: \"I do not have the backing of any major political party, numerous dedicated activists, or the financial resources required by this conventional system. I am only relying on your cooperation and support.\" He also called for \"yes\" votes in the referendum, describing it as an opportunity for national reforms. Asif, previously at the helm of LGRD and sports ministries, handed his resignation from the adviser post to Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus on December 10. On November 9, Asif registered as a voter under the Dhaka-10 constituency. Originally from Cumilla, Asif joined the interim government as a student representative on August 8 last year. He was one of the frontline coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, the platform that led the July mass uprising. He enrolled in the Linguistics Department of Dhaka University in the 2017-18 academic year and completed his undergraduate degree there. He was involved in the politics of Chhatra Odhikar Parishad. Later, in 2023, when a faction of the council formed a new student organisation named Gonotantrik Chhatra Shakti, Asif was one of the initiators. He served as the convener of the Dhaka University chapter of that organisation. Most of the frontline leaders of the July uprising came from this group.",

    "title": "Trump features in newly released Epstein photos",
    "body": "Congressional Democrats released 19 new images from the estate of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, including photos of now-President Donald Trump, as a deadline for an extensive release of documents related to the disgraced financier nears. Trump is featured in three of the photos shared by House Oversight Committee Democrats, who said they are reviewing more than 95,000 images produced by the estate. In one black-and-white photo, Trump is seen smiling with several women — whose faces are redacted — on each side of him. A second image shows Trump standing beside Epstein, and a third, less-clear image shows him seated alongside another woman, whose face is also redacted, with his red tie loosened. It was not clear when or where the photos were taken. \"Everybody knew this man,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. \"He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost - there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him. So that's no big deal.\" The Epstein scandal has been a political headache for Trump for months, partly because he amplified conspiracy theories about Epstein to his own supporters. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found that just half of Republicans approve of Trump's handling of the Epstein case, well below his overall 85% approval rating in his own party. Trump and Epstein were friends during the 1990s and early 2000s, but Trump says he broke off ties before Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges. Trump has consistently denied knowing about Epstein's abuse and sex trafficking of underage girls.",

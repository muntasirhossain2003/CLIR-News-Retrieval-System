    "body": "The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has decided to file 60 separate cases against 124 owners and officials of 60 recruiting agencies for embezzling and laundering Tk 4,545 crore by overcharging workers sent to Malaysia. The decision was taken today at the ACC headquarters, confirmed Director General Md Akhtar Hossain. According to cases, the 124 owners of 60 recruiting agencies embezzled Tk 4,545.20 crore from 267,276 workers. The accused includes proprietors, chairmen, managing directors, directors, and other officials of companies involved in the Malaysian recruitment process. According to the investigation report, the accused formed an organised syndicate while holding various positions in BAIRA and collected several times more than government-set fees through breach of contract and abuse of power. The government-approved cost for sending a worker to Malaysia was Tk 78,990, but the accused allegedly used political influence and BAIRA's internal power circles to inflate costs, while ignoring worker selection procedures, financial processes, and contractual terms. Earlier, 40 separate cases were filed against 108 individuals from 40 overseas companies for embezzling Tk 3,438.94 crore, which are currently under investigation.",

    "body": "Brig Gen (retd) Abdullahil Amaan Azmi, son of former Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Ghulam Azam, was not held at the Joint Interrogation Centre (JIC) known as \"Aynaghar\" but in a 21-by-17-foot air-conditioned room, a defence lawyer told the International Crimes Tribunal-1 yesterday. Azizur Rahman Dulu, counsel for three of the 13 accused charged with illegally detaining and torturing 26 victims between 2015 and last year at the JIC under the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), made the claim while seeking their discharge. Referring to a Bangladesh Army court of inquiry report on Azmi's abduction and disappearance, he said the room had two doors, five windows, a cot, a reading table, a wardrobe, an almirah, and an AC. \"The windows were closed, but there was an AC. This was not Aynaghar,\" he argued. Chief Prosecutor Tajul Islam opposed the argument, saying points from the inquiry report were irrelevant at this stage and could only be raised during trial once the report is submitted. Azizur and co-counsel Mahin R Rahman also argued that the charges of illegal arrest and abduction against their two clients -- former DGFI CTIB directors Brig Gen Md Mahbub Rahman Siddique and Brig Gen Ahmed Tanvir Majahar Siddique -- were baseless, as both joined the DGFI after Azmi and another victim, Michael Chakma, had already been abducted. They said their third client, Maj Gen Sheikh Md Sarwar Hossain, also a former CTIB director under whom the JIC falls, and two other accused could not be held responsible because the JIC was under the DGFI director general. The prosecution countered that a 2006 government order placed the JIC under the CTIB director, and argued that under international law any officer serving during a victim's detention bears responsibility. State-appointed lawyer Amir Hossain, representing the prime accused and deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, sought her discharge, saying she neither ordered illegal detention nor torture, and that the prosecution presented no written order from her. Hassan Imam, counsel for Hasina's former defence and security adviser Maj Gen (retd) Tarique Ahmed Siddique and former DGFI chiefs Lt Gen (retd) Md Akbar Hossain, Lt Gen (retd) Md Saiful Alam, Maj Gen (retd) Md Saiful Abedin and Lt Gen (retd) Ahmed Tabrez Shams Chowdhury, also sought discharge, saying they neither committed the offences nor ordered subordinates to do so. State defence lawyer Sujad Miah, representing four other retired officers, adopted Azizur's arguments and sought their discharge. Maj Gen Sarwar, Brig Gen Mahbub, and Brig Gen Tanvir -- now in custody -- were present in court, while the other 10 accused remain absconding. After the hearing, the tribunal led by Justice Md Shofiul Alam Mahmood set December 14 for its order on whether charges will be framed.",

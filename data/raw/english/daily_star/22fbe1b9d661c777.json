    "body": "BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's condition remained unchanged, with no signs of improvement nor any deterioration as of last night, according to her doctors. She continued to receive treatment at the intensive care unit of Evercare Hospital in Dhaka. Earlier, on Thursday, the doctors confirmed that she is getting \"elective ventilator support\" to rest her lungs and other organs. Elective ventilator support means putting a patient on a ventilator as a planned, non-emergency medical step -- not because they are in sudden respiratory failure, but because doctors believe the patient's organs need rest or support. The 80-year-old former prime minister has long been battling multiple health issues, including liver cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital on November 23 with infections in her heart and lungs. She has recently developed several additional complications, including infective endocarditis, acute pancreatitis, and severe bacterial and fungal infections. On Thursday, the medical board overseeing her treatment confirmed that she is also undergoing regular dialysis due to kidney dysfunction. Doctors diagnosed acute pancreatitis on November 27, and it is still being treated. Her treatment is being carried out based on standard guidelines, according to the recommendations of both local and foreign doctors. The BNP has urged people not to spread misinformation and has requested everyone to pray for Khaleda's swift recovery.",

    "body": "Israeli forces carried out a wave of raids across several parts of the occupied West Bank yesterday morning, arresting more than 100 Palestinians. According to the Palestinian Prisoners' Media Office (ASRA), the most heavily affected areas included Nablus, Silwad and the nearby town of Deir Jarir, northeast of Ramallah. ASRA also reported \"extensive\" arrest operations in Salfit, Hebron, Bethlehem, Qalqilya and Jenin. In Nablus alone, around 30 people — many of them former detainees — were taken in for questioning, with some later released. Another 24 arrests were recorded in Silwad and Deir Jarir, while 20 people were detained in al‑Eizariya and Abu Dis, and more than 14 in Jericho. ASRA said Israeli troops also raided homes and seized personal belongings during the operations. Among those arrested was Nasser al‑Din al‑Shaer, a prominent academic and former minister. Local media, cited by Al Jazeera, reported that forces stormed his home in Nablus during the pre‑dawn sweep. Al‑Shaer previously served as education minister and deputy prime minister in the Palestinian National Authority in the mid‑2000s. Meanwhile, Israel has given final approval for 764 housing units to be built in three settlements in the occupied West Bank, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said yesterday.",

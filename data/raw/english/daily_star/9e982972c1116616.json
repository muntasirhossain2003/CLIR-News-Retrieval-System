    "body": "Fifty-three years after independence, countless stories of the Liberation War still lie hidden in the folds of memory. Part 6 of this series turns to Chattogram, a city where guerrilla fighters stitched fear into the occupiers' ranks through swift, coordinated blows. Chattogram woke before dawn to the roar of fire and shuddering steel -- an electric transformer here, a petrol pump there -- until, within an hour, it became a city of explosions. It was December 6, 1971. Between 3:00am and 4:00am, guerrilla fighters struck 85 points across the city in a single, coordinated wave. They had planned for a hundred. But, as Dr Mahfuzur Rahman, explosives chief and group commander, now 83, recalled, \"Since freedom fighter Syed Emran was caught at the last minute, the 15 operations of his unit were unsuccessful.\" The blasts plunged the Pakistani army into chaos. Freedom fighter Abul Kashem of Pahartali, now 80, said, \"Only the group commanders knew about the coordinated operation for the sake of security. It took at least a week for the Pakistanis to move normally after the strikes.\" During the war, at least 500 guerrillas carried out more than 400 operations here, the highest recorded in any single city. In April, this correspondent spoke with at least 20 freedom fighters in Chattogram. Their memories echo the written record -- Jamal Uddin's \"Muktijuddhe Chattogram Shahor\", Mahfuzur Rahman's \"Banglaeer Jatiyatabadi Sangram Muktijuddhe Chattogram\", and the sector-wise chronicles. Together, they sketch a city quietly preparing for war after Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's March 7 speech. Secret training under Awami League leader Moulvi Syed Ahmed began almost immediately. After March 25, Bangalee soldiers of the Bengal Regiment and EPR resisted but had to withdraw. As Pakistani and Bihari forces seized control and carried out massacres, the city emptied. In early April, students and youths slipped into India for training. Many hesitated, until Moulvi Syed printed a leaflet calling them to arms. The response swept across neighbourhoods, and training began beside Noor Mohammad's house in Chhotopool, Agrabad. Meanwhile, lightly trained Ansar men and guerrillas launched small strikes. After taking oath on May 7, fighters established their main base at Sabujbagh in Panwalapara. Among the earliest major missions was Operation Chawkbazar. On May 18, Jahangir Group fighters spotted four Pakistani soldiers in a jeep and hurled a grenade in Kapasgola, destroying the vehicle and killing the soldiers. Through May and June, their task was to spread dread. Dost Mohammad, now 72, said, \"We arranged shelters for the trained guerrillas who came from India in various houses in the city.\" By June, fighters were slipping back inside Chattogram. Freedom fighter Fazlul Haque Bhuiyan, now 75, said his group returned on June 16 after training in India. \"We had instructions that no Dalal or Razakar would be allowed in the city so that the remaining guerrillas could also enter the city,\" said Nuruddin Chowdhury, now 70. Those fighters trained new recruits in their neighbourhoods. By August, more than a hundred fighters from three Bangladesh Liberation Force groups entered the city. In September, four more BLF groups and at least 40 FF groups arrived, spreading the war across Chattogram. Operations struck the Ice Factory, Kaibalyadham Petrol Train, Hotel Agrabad, American Express Bank, Lajaf Petrol Pump, and the Maykong Chinese Restaurant. In October, the Pakistani regime declared East Pakistan \"normal\", prompting a UN observer team to visit and stay at Hotel Agrabad under tight guard. The fighters vowed to expose the lie. After three days of reconnaissance, they chose the hotel transformer as their mark. On October 23, seven to eight fighters led by Mahfuzur Rahman stormed the site. Shafiq Munshi, now 70, recalled, \"We kept two freedom fighters on guard outside and first held the security guards and the Razakars hostage by pointing revolvers at their chests.\" \"Freedom fighters Faiz and Garibullah burned their hands while trying to install high-explosives in the transformer… Within a short time, the transformer exploded, causing power outages and panic in the area.\" The blast carried the truth to the observers. A week later came Kaibalyadham, the city's most devastating ambush, killing 20 Pakistani soldiers. For three days, fighters tracked an army train moving between Battali-Kattali and Mirsarai. On a bustling market day at Colonel Hat, Raisul Haque Bahar's group slipped into the crowd disguised as foot pilgrims, explosives hidden in their bags. Imtiyar Uddin Pasha, now 73, said, \"As planned, we planted explosives in the evening and hid. When the first two coaches crossed, Bahar Bhai pulled the wire with the T&T cord. A terrible explosion occurred immediately. All the Pakistani soldiers on the train were killed.\" Arms flowed from India along many routes, including Banshbaria via Mirsarai, then travelled by sea through Kattli, said freedom fighter Shafiul Alam, now 73. Sometimes, the delivery required disguise. Mohammad Hossain, now 84, remembered one fighter who posed as a corpse in an ambulance to smuggle weapons. By September, funds ran low. Guerrillas decided to rob the American Express Bank in Agrabad. Under Engineer Harun's leadership, they hijacked a car; Harun waited outside while others stormed the bank at gunpoint. They escaped with Tk 40,000, including Tk 19,000 in cash and the rest in foreign currency, which was handed to Moulvi Syed, said Fazlul. On November 1, they ambushed a central bank vehicle expected to carry Tk 2 lakh to the tax office. But a Pakistani soldier near New Market spotted them, triggering a gunfight. Freedom fighter Rafiq Ahmad was martyred. Three fighters, including Fazlul and Shafiul Bashar, were shot. \"The Pakistanis captured Bashar. We rescued him alive on December 16,\" said Fazlul. At least 20 guerrillas were captured and tortured in Dalim Hotel, Dewan Hotel, Goods Hill, Circuit House, the Stadium, and other centres. On November 22, Jahangir Chowdhury of the 96-FF Group was captured in Madarbari. \"On the orders of Mir Quasem Ali, I was taken to Dalim Hotel, beaten with iron rods and wires every morning and afternoon. They tortured me inhumanely for 23 days until the morning of December 16,\" said Jahangir, now 78. On December 1, KC-7 fighter Syed Mohammad Emran was seized from Chandgaon. He and his six brothers were blindfolded and dragged to Dalim Hotel. \"They hung me upside down from the ceiling and started to beat me. I felt like I spent every day in a city of death until December 16,\" said Emran, now 77. On November 23, Al-Badr militias kidnapped Abul Mansur, a key organiser and postgraduate student of Chittagong University. He was never found, said freedom fighter Touhidul Karim, now 73. City residents risked everything to hide fighters. Safe houses included the homes of Abu Sayeed Sardar in Panwalapara Sabujbagh; Monaf Sawdagar in Hajipara; Noor Mohammad in Chhotapul; Enayet Mawla's 'Kakoli' on OR Nizam Road; and even the shrine of Amanat Shah. Medical shelters rose as well. Kunda Prabha Sen opened a temporary centre in Patharghata; Dr Nurul Alam ran a mobile hospital at Begumjan School; and Dr Mohammad Shahidullah, Dr Anwar Ali, and Manjula Anwar treated the wounded in Agrabad. Dr Mahfuzur said, \"Chattogram city was then a non-Bangalee and Bihari-dominated area. Even so, the people of the city gave us shelter and food at the risk of their lives. I think it was the people who fought, and we cooperated with them.\" The fighters also printed newspapers and leaflets to shape opinion and record their missions. Paramount Press in Madarbari printed the paper, while Sulekha Printing House produced leaflets.",

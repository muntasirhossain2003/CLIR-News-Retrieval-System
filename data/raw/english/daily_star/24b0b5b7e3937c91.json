    "body": "An air ambulance carrying Sharif Osman Hadi, an independent parliamentary aspirant for Dhaka-8 who was shot on Friday, departed Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport for Singapore this afternoon. The aircraft took off at 1:55pm, airport Executive Director Group Captain SM Ragib Samad said. Earlier, at around 11:20am, the air ambulance landed at the airport to transport Hadi to Singapore for advanced medical treatment. The decision to send Hadi abroad was taken last night following an emergency virtual meeting held at the instruction of Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus, said the Chief Adviser's Press Wing. Over the past two days, the government contacted several hospitals in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia regarding Hadi's treatment. After consultations with the specialist team at Evercare Hospital and discussions with Hadi's family members, the matter was placed before the chief adviser, the press wing said. Hadi, who also serves as the spokesperson for Inqilab Moncho, remains in a critical condition after a brazen daylight attack in the capital on December 12. The incident occurred on Box Culvert Road, between DR Tower and Baitus Salam Jame Mosque, around 2:25pm, said Hussain Muhammad Farabi, assistant commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police. The shooting took place a day after the Election Commission announced the schedule for the 13th national election.",

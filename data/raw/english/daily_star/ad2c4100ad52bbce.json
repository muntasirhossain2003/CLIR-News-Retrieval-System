    "body": "Donald Trump has suggested he could withdraw support for Ukraine as he escalated his administration's criticism of Europe, describing the continent as \"weak\" and \"decaying\" and claiming it was \"destroying itself\" through immigration. In an often rambling interview with Politico, released in transcript form yesterday, the US president struggled to name any Ukrainian cities other than Kyiv, mischaracterised aspects of the war's trajectory, and repeated far‑right narratives about European immigration that echoed the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory. Trump called for Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to accept his proposal to cede territory to Russia, arguing that Moscow retained the \"upper hand\" and that Zelensky's government must \"play ball\". In his often halting remarks, Trump swerved from subject to subject while rehearsing familiar grudges and conspiracies. He also declined repeatedly to rule out sending American troops into Venezuela as part of his effort to bring down President Nicolás Maduro, reports The Guardian online. \"I don't want to rule in or out. I don't talk about it,\" Trump said, adding he did not want to talk about military strategy.",

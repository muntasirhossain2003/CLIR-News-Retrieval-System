    "body": "Unesco has recognised the Tangail saree weaving industry as an intangible cultural heritage. The decision was unanimously adopted today at the 20th Intergovernmental Committee meeting of the Unesco 2003 Convention in New Delhi, India today. This is Bangladesh's sixth standalone registration under this convention and the second registration in the last four years after Bangladesh was elected as a member of this committee for the first time, according to a statement issued by the foreign ministry. \"This recognition is a matter of extraordinary glory for Bangladesh. It is the global recognition of the unique artwork of Tangail weavers spanning over two centuries,\" said Ambassador Khondker M Talha, leader of the Bangladesh delegation and permanent representative of Bangladesh to Unesco, in an immediate reaction during the ongoing session. He said he believed that Bangladesh has many intangible cultural elements worthy of Unesco recognition as heritage. The ongoing 20th meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee was inaugurated by India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday. Unesco's newly appointed Director-General, Khaled El Enani joined the event.",

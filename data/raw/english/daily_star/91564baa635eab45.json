    "body": "A bus caught fire while parked at a bus counter near the Police Lines, adjacent to the Cox's Bazar bus terminal, yesterday. The fire broke out around 11:45am, triggering panic among locals and passers-by. Fire Service personnel rushed to the spot upon receiving the alert and managed to bring the blaze under control. Mohammad Tanharul Islam, deputy assistant director of Cox's Bazar Fire Service and Civil Defence, confirmed the incident and said the cause of the fire could not be determined immediately. An investigation will be conducted to ascertain how the fire started, he added. Cox's Bazar Sadar Model Police Station Officer-in-Charge Sami Uddin said no casualties were reported. The driver was not inside the bus belonging to Doel Express at that time, and the helper, who was listening to music inside it, managed to get off, he added. The fire is believed to have started accidentally, said the OC. Although the exact cause remains unclear, some eyewitnesses speculated that the fire may have originated from a cigarette.",

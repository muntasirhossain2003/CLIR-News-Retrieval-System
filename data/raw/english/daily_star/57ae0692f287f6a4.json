    "body": "The Anti-Corruption Students' Platform has demanded the disclosure of wealth statements of Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and Mahfuj Alam, who resigned from their posts as advisers to the interim government yesterday. The group also demanded that records of \"corruption\" that happened under the two former advisers' supervision over the last 17 months be made public. They further said Asif and Mahfuj should not be allowed to contest the upcoming election without a proper corruption investigation. The organisation made the demand during a human chain formed today in front of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) headquarters in Segunbagicha, Dhaka. Former Chhatra Union president Deepak Shil said, \"For a long time, Asif's office had turned into a hub of corruption. A corruption syndicate grew around him and his APS Moazzem. The APS was later removed on corruption charges, and the ACC investigated it. We want to know the progress of that investigation.\" Speakers also alleged that the ACC has remained silent about corruption allegations against the personal assistants (PS) of the two advisers. They claimed the two advisers have lost moral eligibility to contest the polls due to these corruption scandals. They called on the Election Commission and the interim government to bar them from participating in the election. Speakers also said the current ACC has failed to play an effective role in tackling corruption.",

Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police Station Officer-in-Charge Monirul Islam told The Daily Star, \"His family took the body to Gazipur… without informing us. We asked them to bring it back for an autopsy.\" Morshed Alam Torun, convener of the college unit of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, said he heard a scuffle broke out when Rana and other residents protested as several outsiders were taking drugs inside the dormitory on December 6. When Rana and other residents protested, a scuffle broke out. The outsiders then left. About half an hour later, they returned and attacked the students, including Rana, Torun said. Rana's classmate Abu Bakar said he was attacked for protesting drug abuse. He claimed that members of both groups were associated with Chhatra Dal leaders.",

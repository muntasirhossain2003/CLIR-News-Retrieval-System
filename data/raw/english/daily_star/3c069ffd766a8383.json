    "body": "Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami's MP candidate for Dhaka-19 constituency, Maulana Md Afzal Hossain, has said that his party will hold programmes at the National Memorial in Savar on the occasion of the Victory Day on December 16. He made the remarks in response to a question from The Daily Star asking whether his party had plans to hold any programme at the memorial on that day. The MP said the Dhaka-19 constituency has 742,361 voters and is particularly important as it is close to Dhaka and home to several national institutions, including the National Memorial. \"We have programmes at the National Memorial on December 16,\" he said. The MP aspirant said Jamaat had already taken initiatives for programmes on Victory Day. Responding to another question from The Daily Star on whether party leaders would visit the memorial, he said, \"Yes, when we were part of the four-party alliance in the past, our ministers also visited the memorial.\" Through the media, he extended his greetings to the people of Dhaka-19 on the occasion of Victory Day.",

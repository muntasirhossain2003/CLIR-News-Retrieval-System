    "title": "DGFI coerced student leaders to withdraw anti-discrimination movement: Hasnat tells ICT-2",
    "body": "Hasnat Abdullah, a key witness in the case filed over the killing of BRU student Abu Sayed, today testified before the International Crimes Tribunal-2, saying that officials of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) had coerced and tortured him and two other student leaders to force them to withdraw the anti-discrimination student movement. Hasnat, NCP's chief organiser (South), also alleged that intimidation and pressure were used to silence them. The first part of his deposition concluded today, with the remainder scheduled after lunch recess. Hasnat said that on July 17 last year, he and Sarjis Alam, NCP's chief organiser (North), were picked up from a relative's home and taken to State Guest House Padma, where three then-ministers -- Anisul Huq, Mohammad A Arafat, and Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury Nowfel -- later arrived. DGFI officials allegedly insisted they meet the then-ministers for negotiations. \"When we refused to comply without consulting other student coordinators, they threatened to harm our families,\" he told the tribunal. Hasnat further testified that the officials, angered by their refusal, took them to a secret detention facility near Matshya Bhaban and interrogated them overnight. \"At one stage, a DGFI officer threatened that just as they dispersed BNP's October 28 rally in 10 minutes, they could wipe out our movement the same way,\" he said.",

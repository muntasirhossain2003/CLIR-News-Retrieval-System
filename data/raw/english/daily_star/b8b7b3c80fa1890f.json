    "body": "A factory worker was killed in a stabbing incident in Shahidnagar, Lalbagh in Dhaka. The victim, Mohammad Hossain, 25, was attacked around 3:30 pm today in Shahidnagar Lane No 2. He was rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital in critical condition, where doctors declared him dead at 4:15 pm. Inspector Md Faruk of Dhaka Medical College Hospital police camp confirmed the death, saying stab wounds were found in Hossain's chest and abdomen. The body has been sent for autopsy, and Lalbagh police have been informed, he added. Abdul Rakib, a friend of Hossain, who brought him to the hospital, told The Daily Star that an altercation began on Monday night when Hossain and another friend, Nirab, were passing through that lane. \"Nirab was carrying an iron pipe. A local youth, Abir, 28, saw that and demanded the pipe from him. When Nirab refused, Abir slapped him several times. Hossain protested and slapped Abir in retaliation,\" Rakib said. Local elders settled the dispute that night. On Tuesday afternoon, while Hossain was returning home after work, Abir allegedly ambushed him in that lane and stabbed him several times with a knife. Locals caught Abir immediately, while Hossain was taken to the hospital. Hossain's sister Suraiya Akter said her brother worked at a jewellery factory near their home in Shahidnagar. She confirmed that Abir was involved but did not know the motive. Officer-in-Charge of Lalbagh Police Station, Md Yasin Ali, said police were dispatched to the scene and hospital to investigate further.",

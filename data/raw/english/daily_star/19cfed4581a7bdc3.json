    "body": "Heavily armed militants looted several banks in Pakistan's Balochistan province yesterday before clashing with security forces, with one policeman and a civilian killed, authorities told AFP. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack in southwest Pakistan, where ethnic Baloch separatists have stepped up attacks on security forces in recent years. \"It was an organised heist in which at least three banks were looted of about 150 million Pakistani rupees (around $530,000),\" a police official in the Panjgur district said. \"They tried to loot two more banks before clashes erupted with security forces, forcing them to flee,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to talk to the media.",

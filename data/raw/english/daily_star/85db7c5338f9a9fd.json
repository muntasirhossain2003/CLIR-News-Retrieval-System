    "body": "A Tejgaon College student died today after battling for four days with injuries sustained in a clash at the college dormitory. Sakibul Hasan Rana, 18, a second-year Higher Secondary science student, passed away around noon while undergoing treatment in the ICU of a private hospital in Moghbazar. Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police Station Officer-in-Charge Monirul Islam told The Daily Star that tension erupted between two groups at the dormitory on the night of December 6. Rana sustained a severe head injury in what escalated into a violent confrontation \"His body was taken by his family to Gazipur from the hospital without informing the police. We asked them to bring the body back for an autopsy,\" the OC said, adding that no case has been filed yet. Morshed Alam Torun, convener of the Tejgaon College unit of Chhatra Dal, said he heard that some former dormitory residents and outsiders were taking drugs inside the dormitory on December 6. When Rana and other residents protested, a scuffle broke out. Torun added that he and other Chhatra Dal leaders mediated the matter. The outsider group, about half an hour later, allegedly came back and attacked the students, injuring four, including Rana. Abu Bakar, a classmate and friend of Rana, said he was attacked for protesting drug abuse. He claimed that members of both groups were associated with Chhatra Dal leaders. He added that students will hold a protest tomorrow demanding justice for the killing.",

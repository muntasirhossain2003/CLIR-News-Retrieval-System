    "title": "31 ADCs assigned ahead of national election",
    "body": "The government has transferred 31 senior assistant secretaries to different district administrations ahead of the national election. These officers will serve as additional deputy commissioners (ADCs). Most of them were previously working in different ministries and divisions. The Ministry of Public Administration published a notification in this regard on Monday. Talking to reporters, officials involved in the process today said further ADC-level postings are likely. Earlier, the government reshuffled deputy commissioners (DCs) in more than 50 districts and transferred over 200 upazila nirbahi officers (UNOs). Work is now underway to finalise additional ADC postings, and another transfer order may be issued before the election schedule is announced, as there is still demand for more officers. The transferred officers have been given the powers of executive magistrates under Section 10(2) of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The newly assigned officers must join their new workplaces by December 11, the notification read. Otherwise, they will be considered \"stand released\" from their current posts on the afternoon of the same date, the notification added.",

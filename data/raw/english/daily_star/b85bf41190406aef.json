    "title": "‘Deeply disrespectful’: ASK slams RU teacher over post on Begum Rokeya",
    "body": "Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) has condemned a Facebook post by a Rajshahi University (RU) teacher who referred to women's rights pioneer Begum Rokeya as a \"murtad\" (apostate) and \"kafir\" (non-believer), calling the remarks \"unacceptable\" and \"deeply disrespectful.\" In a statement today, ASK said the comment \"exceeds the limits of irresponsibility\" and serves to incite social division, misogyny and hate speech -- constituting a violation of human rights standards, state law, and academic ethics. The post, shared on Tuesday by Khandker Mahmudul Hasan, associate professor of physics at RU, read, \"Today is the birthday of murtad kafir Begum Rokeya.\" When contacted by journalists, Mahmudul said his post reflected his personal religious interpretation and that a detailed explanation was included in the original post. ASK said Begum Rokeya is not only an icon but a foundational figure in the women's emancipation movement in Bengal, arguing that insulting her undermines decades of social progress. \"Such remarks are an affront to the achievements of Bangladeshi women and to the values of equality and dignity,\" the rights organisation said. The organisation urged RU and relevant authorities to take appropriate action to uphold academic integrity and prevent the spread of hate speech in educational spaces.",

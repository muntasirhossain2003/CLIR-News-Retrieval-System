    "title": "EC restores Bagerhat seats, reduces Gazipur’s following court verdict",
    "body": "The Election Commission (EC) issued a circular on Thursday restoring the number of parliamentary seats in Bagerhat from three to four and reducing Gazipur's seats from six to five. The move followed Wednesday's Supreme Court decision upholding a High Court verdict that declared the EC's earlier gazette \"illegal\", which had reduced Bagerhat's seats and increased Gazipur's. On September 4, the EC finalised the boundaries of 300 constituencies, redrawing 46 seats across 16 districts. Before that, the commission held hearings over four days starting August 24, after receiving claims, objections, recommendations, and opinions on the draft boundaries. The hearings covered 84 constituencies in 33 districts. The draft was originally published on July 30, after which the EC received 1,185 objections and 708 recommendations.",

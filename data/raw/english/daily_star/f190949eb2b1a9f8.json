Talking to journalists after inspecting the Narsingdi District Jail, he said he had found that most of the inmates are drug users. \"Drugs have no benefit. We will raise public awareness about the dangers of drug abuse,\" he added. \"The quality of food provided to inmates has improved compared to before,\" he said. The adviser said, in Narsigdi's Raipura upazila, incidents of murder and clashes take place frequently. \"Criminals are freely committing crimes, including killings. There are many criminal hideouts and a large presence of illegal weapons,\" he added.

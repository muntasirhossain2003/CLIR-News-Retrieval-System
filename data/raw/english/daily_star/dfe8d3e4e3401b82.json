    "body": "The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) today ordered the authorities to publish notices in two national daily newspapers asking absconding accused Sajeeb Wazed Joy to appear before the court on December 17 in a case over alleged crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising. The three-member tribunal, led by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, passed the order following a petition by Chief Prosecutor Tajul Islam, who said Joy had been shown as absconding in the case. The tribunal directed the prosecution to submit a report on December 17 after the publication of the notices. Former state minister for information and communication technology Zunaid Ahmed Palak has also been named as an accused in the case. Palak, who is currently under arrest, was produced before the tribunal today. During the hearing, Palak's counsel, M Liton Ahmed, told the court that his client had earlier been allowed to meet family members in prison and communicate by phone, but those facilities were reportedly withdrawn following an incident in which Palak chanted \"Joy Bangla\" and sang the national anthem inside a prison van. The lawyer sought the tribunal's intervention to ensure that prison authorities uphold Palak's legal rights to communication. In response, the tribunal said it would issue necessary directions to ensure compliance with the law. The prosecution submitted formal charges against Joy and Palak on December 4 in connection with the case.",

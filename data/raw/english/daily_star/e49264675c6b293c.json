    "body": "The United Nations yesterday hit out at global \"apathy\" over widespread suffering as it launched its 2026 appeal for humanitarian assistance, which is limited in scope as aid operations confront major funding cuts. \"This is a time of brutality, impunity and indifference,\" UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told reporters, condemning \"the ferocity and the intensity of the killing, the complete disregard for international law, horrific levels of sexual violence\" he had seen on the ground in 2025. \"This is a time when the rules are in retreat, ...our survival antennae have been numbed by distraction and corroded by apathy,\" he said. He said it was also a time \"when politicians boast of cutting aid,\" as he unveiled a plan to raise at least $23 billion to help 87 million people.",

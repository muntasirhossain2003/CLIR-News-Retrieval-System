    "body": "Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) has expressed concern and condemned the arrest of journalist Anis Alamgir under the Anti-Terrorism Act, terming the move a threat to the core principles of a democratic state and a direct attack on freedom of speech. In a press release issued today, the human rights organisation said Anis had been vocal in analysing and criticising various government policies and actions through television talk shows and other media. ASK said that filing an anti-terrorism case against a journalist for expressing opinions reflects a \"clear misuse of the law.\" According to ASK, the application of such laws against journalists contradicts democratic principles and directly undermines constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech. Such actions create fear among media professionals and discourage them from carrying out their work, cautioned the organisation. It also noted that criticism of government or state policies does not constitute a criminal offence and stressed that any alleged offence must be addressed through fair and lawful procedures. Demanding the immediate withdrawal of the case against Anis, ASK urged the authorities to refrain from abusing laws against journalists and to ensure a safe and enabling environment for free, independent, and critical journalism.",

    "body": "US officials are working on a plan for a reorganization of the military requested by Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that would reduce four-star generals and consolidate some international command centers, the Washington Post reported on Monday. If adopted, the proposal would mark one of the most significant changes at the military's top ranks in decades, the newspaper reported, citing five sources familiar with the matter. US Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine was expected to present the plan to Hegseth in coming days, a senior defense official familiar with the discussion told the Washington Post. A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment. Under the plan, officials would \"reduce the prominence\" of the US Central Command, US European Command and US Africa Command and put them under control of a new organization known as US International Command, the newspaper reported. It added it would also cut the number of generals and admirals who report directly to Hegseth. The changes would have to be approved by both the Pentagon chief and US President Donald Trump to have any effect.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump hinted that Republicans could lose the 2026 midterm elections, despite touting the \"greatest economy in history,\" in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Saturday. The Republican, who returned to the White House in January, has regularly insisted that the US economy is now booming, as he continues to blame inflation on his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. \"I've created the greatest economy in history. But it may take people a while to figure all these things out,\" Trump said in the interview, which the Journal said was conducted Friday in the Oval Office. \"All this money that's pouring into our country is building things right now—car plants, AI, lots of stuff. I cannot tell you how that's going to equate to the voter, all I can do is do my job.\" With the 2026 midterm elections looming, Trump stressed that \"prices are in good shape.\"",

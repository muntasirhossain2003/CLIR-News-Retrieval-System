    "body": "Robin Khuda, Bangladesh-born founder of the Australian data centre company AirTrunk, has been named to \"Forbes Asia's 2025 Heroes of Philanthropy\" list. The recognition follows his major donation to support education and address gender inequality in technology. He donated 100 million Australian dollars (US$66 million) to the University of Sydney, the largest single philanthropic gift in the university's history. The funding, provided through the Khuda Family Foundation, will support a 20-year programme for girls and women pursuing STEM careers. It will offer scholarships and long-term support from high school to university. The announcement came two months after the $24 billion Australian dollars acquisition of AirTrunk by a consortium led by Blackstone. Robin Khuda established the foundation with his wife, Melea Walker-Khuda, in 2020 to work towards gender equality in the tech sector. Forbes Asia's 19th edition highlights ten individuals and families across the Asia-Pacific region who have made major personal contributions to charity. Education remains a key focus of this year's list.",

    "title": "SC upholds HC verdict declaring re-demarcation of Bagerhat, Gazipur seats illegal",
    "body": "The Supreme Court today upheld a High Court verdict that declared illegal the Election Commission's (EC) gazette notification which reduced the number of parliamentary seats in Bagerhat from four to three and increased the number of seats in Gazipur from five to six. A bench of the Appellate Division headed by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed dismissed a leave-to-appeal petition that challenged the High Court judgement. Following a writ petition, the HC on November 10 declared illegal the EC's gazette notification and also ordered the commission to restore the constituencies of the districts to their previous form. The bench of Justice Sashanka Shekhar Sarkar and Justice Faysal Hasan Arif delivered the verdict after hearing a petition filed by Bagerhat Press Club, its District Bar Association, BNP, Jamaat, Islami Andolan, and the Truck Owners' Association challenging the legality of the EC's decision.",

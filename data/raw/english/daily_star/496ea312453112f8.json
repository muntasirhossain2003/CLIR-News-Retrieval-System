    "body": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez condemned as \"unacceptable\" the \"extrajudicial operations\" carried out by the United States on alleged drug-trafficking boats off Venezuela, in an interview published yesterday. Speaking to Italy's L'Espresso magazine, the Socialist premier urged a peaceful resolution to the growing crisis between President Donald Trump's administration and Caracas, which have sparked fears of an open conflict. Asked about what the reporter characterised as US extrajudicial killings in international waters, Sanchez said: \"The questioning of international law is, once again, worrying.\" He said the operations fuel criticism that the West is inconsistent and applies \"double standards\" on defending international law. \"In my opinion, these extrajudicial operations are unacceptable, they undermine international law.\" The United States imposed sanctions Thursday against relatives of Venezulan leader Nicolas Maduro and six companies shipping the South American country's oil. President Donald Trump's administration has been piling pressure on Venezuela for months, with a major naval buildup in the region that has been accompanied by deadly strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats, killing nearly 90 people.",

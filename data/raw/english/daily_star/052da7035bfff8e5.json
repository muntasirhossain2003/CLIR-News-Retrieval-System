    "body": "In a bid to find a sustainable solution to the long-standing crisis created due to hawkers in the port city, Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Mayor Shahadat Hossain has announced plans to construct underground markets at key intersections. At a coordination committee meeting held at the CCC office today, he said, \"The occupation of footpaths by hawkers is one of the primary reasons for the city's persistent traffic congestion and the extreme suffering of pedestrians.\" \"To address this, we are planning to build underground markets, following successful models seen in many developed countries,\" he added. The mayor identified four high-traffic points for the initial phase of the project: EPZ, Agrabad, Bahaddarhat and Station Road areas. He added that preliminary discussions have already taken place with a Chinese firm regarding the implementation of this model. Beyond the underground infrastructure, the mayor said efforts are underway to allocate vacant land owned by Bangladesh Railway near the Chattogram Railway Station to temporarily relocate hawkers. The mayor noted that his administration is moving toward a long-term and effective solution to restore order to Chattogram city's streets.",

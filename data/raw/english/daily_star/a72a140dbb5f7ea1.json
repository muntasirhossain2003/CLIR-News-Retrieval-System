During the operation, two workers were detained and a stash of soaps, soap-making and packaging materials were seized. The illegal factory had long been producing adulterated soaps using unauthorised raw materials and selling those using counterfeit packaging of different brands such as \"Dettol\", said Rab officials. \"Without BSTI licences and certificates, the factory had been operating at night inside a rickshaw garage. Acting on a tip-off, Rab raided the factory and found a huge quantity of adulterated soap ready for packaging with counterfeit branding,\" said Lt Col Hafizur Rahman, commanding officer of Rab-7.",

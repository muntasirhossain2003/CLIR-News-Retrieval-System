    "body": "A group of Dhaka University students today burned images of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of undermining Bangladesh's Victory Day. The demonstration, held around 4:45pm in front of the Dhaka University Central Students' Union (Ducsu) building, saw protesters chanting slogans and staging symbolic acts of resistance. Event organiser Riyad Jubaha alleged that Modi had been involved in the repression of minorities in India and claimed that his supporters in Bangladesh ignored public opinion by facilitating his presence. He further accused India of playing a role in years of misrule in Bangladesh, saying the protest was aimed at resisting Indian \"hegemony.\" Earlier in the day, around 1:00pm, another group of students hurled shoes at a photograph of Ghulam Azam in front of the Ducsu building, chanting slogans against collaborators of the 1971 Liberation War. Dhaka University student Hisham Anwar of the 2024-25 academic session said, \"Ghulam Azam and his associates opposed the Liberation War. Their successors are now trying to portray the war as a conspiracy.\" He explained that the shoe-throwing programme was organised on Victory Day to protest such attempts to distort the history of Bangladesh's liberation war.",

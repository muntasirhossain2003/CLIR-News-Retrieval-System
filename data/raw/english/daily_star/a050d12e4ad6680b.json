    "body": "Highlighting the importance of safer, fairer and skilled migration, Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus today said submission of fake documents has emerged as a major barrier to sending people abroad, despite major opportunities offered by destination countries for Bangladeshis. \"Bangladesh has become quite famous globally for the submission of fake documents,\" he said, noting that the country continues to face the same complaints from receiving nations. Prof Yunus cited an example raised by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to illustrate the severity of the problem. He said the migration system is heavily dominated by brokers and syndicates, where the government's role remains limited. The chief adviser also warned that the widespread use of fake documents is leading to doors closing for Bangladeshi workers seeking employment abroad. Prof Yunus was speaking at a function in Dhaka marking the International Migration and National Expatriates Day. Adviser for Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment, Asif Nazrul, among others, was present at the event. International Migrants Day (IMD) is observed on December 18, reaffirming the need for safer, more inclusive, and fairer migration systems in a rapidly changing world.",

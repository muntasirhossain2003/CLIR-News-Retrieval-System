    "body": "BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia remains in critical condition in the intensive care unit of Evercare Hospital in Dhaka, where she has been receiving treatment for the last 21 days. The BNP Media Cell said last night that her condition remains unchanged. Meanwhile, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir expressed deep concern over Khaleda's health, describing the situation as worrying. \"We cannot even speak with a smile. Every moment it feels like she is in a serious condition. She has spent her entire life fighting for the people of this country,\" he said at a programme in Dhaka. Doctors said on Thursday that the former prime minister has been placed on elective ventilator support to allow her lungs and other organs to rest. The BNP chief has developed several additional complications, including ineffective endocarditis, acute pancreatitis, and severe bacterial and fungal infections. Khaleda, 80, was admitted to the hospital on November 23 on the advice of her medical board after being diagnosed with infections in her heart and lungs. She has long been battling multiple health issues, including liver cirrhosis, arthritis, diabetes, and chronic problems affecting her kidneys, lungs, heart, and eyes. Dr Zubaida Rahman, wife of BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman, arrived in Dhaka on December 5 and has been looking after her treatment since then.",

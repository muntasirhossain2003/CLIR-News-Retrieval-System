    "body": "The day before, a group of freedom fighters had captured Pateshwari and taken position at Baghbanda. The unit was led by EPR Nayek Ukya ching Marma. Beside a small stream, the freedom fighters quickly dug bunkers and established a defensive position in the shortest possible time. Just then, sensing the presence of the freedom fighters, the Pakistani forces suddenly roared into action with artillery fire. Despite heavy artillery, mortar, and machine-gun fire throughout the night, the freedom fighters did not respond. By dawn the shelling stopped, and the Pakistanis assumed the freedom fighters were either dead or had retreated. Around 8:00 am, a company of Indian troops led by a major and a captain arrived at Baghbanda. Throughout the day, Ukya Ching secretly reconnoitred the area with the Indian officers and observed Pakistani soldiers in high spirits, casually having tea and snacks while several women attended to them inside the camp. A night assault was planned under Ukya Ching Marma's leadership. After a day of secret preparation, Mukti Bahini and Indian forces launched a surprise attack around 8:00 pm. Despite brief resistance, Ukya Ching's precise planning and LMG-grenade traps overwhelmed the enemy, forcing them to flee under cover of darkness. Bhurungamari was liberated from the Pakistan army. For this battle, Nayek Ukya Ching Marma was awarded the title of Bir Bikram, becoming the only indigenous freedom fighter to receive this gallantry award during the Liberation War. The heroic exploits of this decorated freedom fighter have been documented in several books. Notable among them are \"Muktijuddhe Adibashi\" by Ayub Hossain and Charu Haque, and \"Adibashi Muktijoddha\" by Tapan Kumar Dey. In addition, accounts of his wartime experiences can also be found in Ukya Ching Marma's own memoirs. November 19, 1971, Rayganj of Bhurungamari, Kurigram. With the objective of capturing Rayganj, Ukya Ching Marma arrived at Choudhury Haat in Bhurungamari along with a group of freedom fighters. Although the plan was to launch the attack at around 11:30 pm, the Pakistani forces suddenly detected the presence of the freedom fighters. Caught under heavy Pakistani artillery and mortar fire from both sides of the river, along with relentless machine-gun fire raining down like a storm, the Bengali fighters quickly began to lose morale, and extreme chaos broke out among them. At that critical moment, Second Lieutenant Ashfakus Samad and Nayek Ukya Ching Marma thundered out a call: \"No one will retreat even an inch. If we die, we all die together. If we live, we all live together.\" Instantly, the freedom fighters regained their lost morale. A fierce and bloody battle with the Pakistani forces began. In the all-night long fighting, 50–60 Pakistani soldiers were killed. After fighting heroically throughout the night, Ashfakus Samad Bir Uttam was martyred at dawn. Even then, Ukya Ching Marma continued to lead the battle. At one stage, the main force advanced under the leadership of Sector 6 Commander Wing Commander Mohammad Khademul Bashar. Following continuous Mukti Bahini operations from the dawn of November 19 until the evening of November 20, the Pakistani 25 Punjab Regiment finally retreated at dawn on November 21 to Nageshwari, five miles away. Rayganj was liberated. It was not only these two operations. From the very beginning of the Liberation War, Ukya Ching displayed immense bravery by taking part in one battle after another in Sector 6. Among these engagements, the battles of Hatibandha, Pakhiura, Roumari, and Rayganj are particularly notable. At the beginning of the war in March, Ukya Ching Marma was serving as a Nayek at the Hatibandha BOP (Border Outpost) in Lalmonirhat. Ten Bengali soldiers were stationed there, with Habildar Mazharul as the commander and Ukya Ching as the deputy commander. Initially, neither Ukya Ching nor the Bengali soldiers at the BOP were aware of the events of March 25. Even on the afternoon of March 26, Ukya Ching went to Hatibandha market on patrol, as usual. While talking to people in the market, he began to sense the gravity of the country's tense situation. On his way back from the market, he encountered a signalman from the EPR company headquarters, who warned him that non-Bengali and Pakistani soldiers could launch an attack on them at any moment. Upon hearing this, Ukya Ching urged Habildar Mazharul to declare rebellion and join the war. However, Mazharul wanted to observe the situation a little longer. The next morning, Mazharul went to Rangpur. Ukya Ching assigned two soldiers at the BOP to guard the arms and ammunition. Meanwhile, wireless communication was down, and there was no contact with anyone. They kept the Punjabi and Bihari soldiers at the BOP under strict surveillance. Two days later, Habildar Mazharul returned from Rangpur and informed them that the war had begun, describing how Pakistani forces had carried out brutal genocide on the night of March 25. A day later, Company Commander Subedar Arab Ali sent orders through a messenger instructing them to join the war. Ukya Ching Marma was already prepared for combat. Using a special tactical approach, he led the remaining Bengali soldiers to detain the Pakistani and Bihari personnel stationed at the BOP and handed them over to the local populace, after which he joined the Liberation War. This fearless freedom fighter breathed his last on July 25, 2014 at his home in Bandarban.",

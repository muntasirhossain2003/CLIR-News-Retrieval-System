    "title": "HC rejects writ petition seeking IGP Baharul’s removal",
    "body": "The High Court today rejected a writ petition that sought its order on the government to immediately remove Inspector General of Police (IGP) Baharul Alam from the office based on the findings of National Independent Investigation Commission report on the 2009 BDR carnage. The HC bench of Justice Sikder Mahmudur Razi and Justice Raziuddin Ahmed passed the rejection order as the petitioner or his lawyer was not present in the courtroom for placing arguments on the matter, Additional Attorney General Md Arshadur Rouf told The Daily Star. Supreme Court Advocate SM Zulfiqure Ali Junu submitted the petition on December 10, praying to the HC to direct the authorities concerned to initiate lawful proceedings, including departmental prosecution, against Baharul. He said in the petition that on February 25 and 26, 2009, the force then known as Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), presently BGB, witnessed a mutiny at its headquarters in Dhaka's Pilkhana in which dozens of army officers, BDR officers and others were brutally killed. The National Independent Investigation Commission in its probe has found that Baharul Alam, the then additional IGP, had provided misleading and assumption-based intelligence, instead of objectively identifying the real perpetrators, the petition said. Baharul continues to hold the office of IGP, placed in charge of the national law-enforcement apparatus and undermining public confidence in the rule of law and justice for the victims' families, lawyer Zulfiqure said in the petition.",

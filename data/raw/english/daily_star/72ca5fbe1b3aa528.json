    "body": "Tension between Jamaat-e-Islami and the BNP over election campaigning in the Sirajganj-1 (Kazipur) constituency erupted into violence last night, injuring around 15 Jamaat activists, party sources said. The BNP has denied involvement, blaming locals for the clash. The incident occurred around 11:00pm at an Islamic gathering in Sthalbari village of Sonamukhi union. Jamaat-backed MP candidate and Sirajganj district ameer Maulana Shahinur Alam was attacked while leaving the venue. Local witnesses said Shahinur Alam had been invited as a guest to the waz mahfil, where BNP-nominated candidate Selim Reza was also present. Supporters of the two candidates reportedly became agitated during the event. Sensing tensions, Selim Reza calmed his followers and left the stage. The attack on the Jamaat candidate occurred later as he departed. Shahinur told The Daily Star that \"BNP activists had carried out a pre-planned attack.\" BNP leader Selim Reza countered, saying the Jamaat candidate \"had arrived with a show of force, accompanied by Jamaat cadres from nearby upazilas and some Awami League supporters. Locals did not take it well, and the situation turned into a clash. BNP had no role in the incident.\" Kazipur Police Station Officer-in-Charge Shah Enayetur Rahman said no written complaint had been filed yet. \"We will take action after investigation if a complaint is lodged,\" he added.",

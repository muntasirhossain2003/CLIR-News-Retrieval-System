    "body": "A series of Israeli strikes hit south and east Lebanon yesterday, state media reported, as Israel's army said it was targeting Hezbollah sites, the latest such raids despite a year-old ceasefire. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported strikes in around a dozen locations, including up to around 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the Israeli border, citing at times \"heavy raids\". Israel has kept up strikes on Lebanon despite a November 2024 ceasefire and has also kept troops in five areas it deems strategic. The Israeli military said in a statement that its forces \"struck a training and qualification compound\" used by Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force where operatives \"underwent shooting exercises and additional training on the use of various types of weapons\".",

The crash occurred around 4:30am. Friends rushed the injured students to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where doctors declared Tahsin dead around 5:00am. Iram succumbed to his injuries about half an hour later while undergoing treatment.

He added that the motorcycle was struck head-on by the truck, which was coming from the wrong direction. The incident is under investigation.

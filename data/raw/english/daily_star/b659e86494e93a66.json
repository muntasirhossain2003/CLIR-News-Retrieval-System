    "body": "Benin yesterday jailed around 30 people, most of them soldiers, accused of links to a thwarted coup attempt earlier this month, legal sources told AFP. Soldiers appeared on national television on December 7 to announce President Patrice Talon had been deposed but the attempted putsch was swiftly defeated by loyalist army forces with the help of the Nigerian air force and French special forces. Several people were killed and the alleged coup leader lieutenant-colonel Pascal Tigri and other mutinous soldiers are still on the run. On Monday, the around 30 accused appeared in front of a special prosecutor for the court for economic crimes and terrorism in the city of Cotonou, the sources said. They were placed in pre-trial detention the following day at the end of their hearing, they added. They are being prosecuted for \"treason\", \"murder\" and \"endangering state security\", the sources said. A heavy security deployment could be seen around the court, an AFP journalist saw.",

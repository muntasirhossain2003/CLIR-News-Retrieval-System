    "title": "Victory Day without visitors at Tajuddin Ahmad’s birthplace",
    "body": "For the first time since independence, no visitors came to the birthplace of Tajuddin Ahmad in Dardariya, Kapasia, Gazipur, on Victory Day. Tajuddin was the first prime minister of independent Bangladesh, a leading figure in the independence struggle and a successful organiser of the Liberation War. The main house, made of mud, bears traces of his childhood memories and simplicity. There is no boundary wall around the house, and the premises remain open to all. A mosque, a primary school and a large playground stand next to the house. The trees surrounding the property, the habitat of wild animals and the nearby pond reflect a sense of serenity. After the Liberation War and independence, the house became a tourist attraction. Siam, a student of Sreepur Government College, said, \"I have come to this house like every year; today, I am completely disappointed. There is no one; it seems that people are forgetting this great leader.\" Khoka, the caretaker of the house, said, \"Previously, many used to visit on Victory Day. This year, no one came. Freedom fighters used to come on Victory Day; however, this time they did not visit either.\" Sakhawat Hossain, headmaster of nearby Dardariya Government Primary School, said, \"No visitors were seen at Tajuddin Ahmed's house today. However, Victory Day was celebrated at the school. School teachers and prominent people from the area sat down with the students and held a discussion meeting.\"",

    "body": "BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia remains in critical condition in the intensive care unit of Evercare Hospital in Dhaka, where she has been receiving treatment for the last 23 days. The former prime minister has been placed on elective ventilator support to rest her lungs and other organs, her doctors said. The BNP Media Cell last night said her condition remains unchanged. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir yesterday sought prayers for Khaleda's recovery, describing her as the first female freedom fighter and a tireless guardian of democracy who has fought relentlessly for independence and sovereignty. He said the BNP chief is now seriously ill and urged people to pray for her recovery. Khaleda has developed several additional complications, including ineffective endocarditis, acute pancreatitis and severe bacterial and fungal infections. Khaleda, 80, was admitted to the hospital on November 23 on the advice of her medical board after being diagnosed with infections in her heart and lungs. She has long been battling multiple complications, including liver cirrhosis, arthritis, diabetes and chronic issues affecting her kidneys, lungs, heart and eyes. Dr Zubaida Rahman, wife of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, arrived in Dhaka on December 5 to look after her treatment.",

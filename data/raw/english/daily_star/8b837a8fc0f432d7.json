    "body": "A local trader was hacked to death by unidentified miscreants in Dhaka's Dakkhinkhan last night. The deceased was identified as Shahjahan Dealer, 45, a resident of the Ashkona Panir Pump area. He provided cable TV service in the area. Police and local sources said he was a member of the local Jubo League. A witness said four men armed with sharp weapons chased Shahjahan before attacking him. They described the assault as \"barbaric\", saying the attackers struck the victim's head indiscriminately. Dakkhinkhan Police Station Officer-in-Charge Shoriful Islam said the incident occurred around 9:00pm when Shahjahan went to Noddapara's Taltola area for business purposes. Miscreants attacked him when he was standing next to a roadside phone top-up shop, he said. Police said they are collecting and reviewing CCTV footage from the area to identify and arrest those involved in the murder. Dakkhinkhan Police Station Sub-Inspector Saiful Islam said no one had been arrested as of midnight, but the operation was ongoing. \"The motive is not immediately clear. The body will be taken to a hospital morgue for autopsy.\"",

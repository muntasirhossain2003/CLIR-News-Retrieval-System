    "body": "Mobile phone traders and their employees blocked Dhaka's Karwan Bazar intersection this evening, protesting the government's decision to deactivate unauthorised handsets from December 16 under the National Equipment Identity Register (NEIR) system. The demonstration began around 5:45pm, when several hundred traders launched a sit-in, bringing traffic in the surrounding areas to a standstill. Speaking to The Daily Star, Imran Hossain, a mobile phone trader from Bashundhara City Shopping Complex, said they are demanding amendments to the newly introduced NEIR policy. \"Under the NEIR system, we have to pay around 57 percent tax to import mobile phones, which would nearly double the retail prices,\" he said. \"We will not leave the streets until the government announces necessary amendments to the NEIR,\" he added. Contacted, Sobdul Ali Mollah, inspector at Karwan Bazar traffic signal point, said, \"Mobile phone traders blocked the intersection around 5:40pm, and vehicular movement has remained suspended since then.\" The protesters are continueing the blockade, Inspector Sobdul told The Daily Star around 8:00pm.",

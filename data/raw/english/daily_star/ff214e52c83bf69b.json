    "body": "Following the recent earthquakes, at least 147 of the total 1,285 government primary schools in Jashore have been declared risky. Thousands of children have to attend classes in unsafe buildings. The Jashore District Primary Education Office prepared the list after the earthquakes and has submitted it to the Directorate of Primary Education, said District Primary Education Officer Ashraful Alam. Of the risky buildings, 41 are in Sharsha, 29 in Manirampur, 25 in Jhikargachha, 15 in Bagharpara, 12 in Chaugachha, 18 in Jashore Sadar, four in Keshabpur and three in Abhaynagar upazilas. At Ghop Seba Sangha Govt Primary School in Jashore town, cracks run through the walls and plaster continues to fall. \"We have no alternative classrooms, so we are compelled to continue classes in this building,\" said Headteacher Saeeda Yasmin. \"The upazila office has declared it risky, and we have applied for a new structure.\" Conditions are even worse at Nalia Govt Primary School in Fatehpur under Sadar upazila. Large sections of plaster have eroded, the tin roof is broken, and classrooms flood even in light rain. Bamboo poles now hold up parts of the roof. Nearly all the school buildings marked unsafe across the district are in a similar condition, with severe cracks, leaking roofs, poor ventilation and lighting, and unhygienic sanitation. Officials say all the schools require urgent repair or reconstruction. \"We submitted Jashore's list after receiving instructions to identify structurally vulnerable buildings... We are now awaiting further directives from the Directorate of Primary Education,\" said Ashraful.",

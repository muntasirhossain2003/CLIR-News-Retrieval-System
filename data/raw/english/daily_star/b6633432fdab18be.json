    "title": "Entry of unauthorised persons in SC courtrooms prohibited",
    "body": "The Supreme Court administration has prohibited the entry of litigants and unauthorised persons -- except lawyers -- into the courtrooms of both divisions of the Supreme Court to enhance security. SC Registrar General Mohammad Habibur Rahman Siddiquee issued a notification yesterday, saying that the Supreme Court is the highest institution of the country's judiciary and a highly important establishment. The chief justice of Bangladesh and the judges of both divisions of the SC conduct judicial proceedings there; therefore, ensuring the security of the SC is essential, the notice said. It further noted that recently it has been observed that some litigants, case-related individuals, and unauthorised persons entering the courtrooms have been creating obstacles to security, a peaceful environment, and the smooth conduct of judicial proceedings. This is disrupting the security of the judges of both Appellate and High Court Divisions of the SC as well as lawyers and officers and staff. In such circumstances, for security reasons, the entry of litigants or any unauthorised persons -- except lawyers -- into the courtrooms (ejlases) of both divisions will remain restricted/controlled. In addition, any kind of assembly or procession within the SC premises, and the carrying of any legal or illegal weapons, deadly arms, explosives, or narcotics, has been completely prohibited.",

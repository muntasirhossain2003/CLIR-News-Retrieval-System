    "body": "Neighbours suspect burglary the village of Sharif Osman Hadi, convener of Inqilab Moncho, in Jhalakathi as two strangers broke into the house early today. After receiving news of Hadi being shot yesterday, his family members immediately left for Dhaka, leaving the house in Khasmahal area of Nalchhiti municipality empty. However, the main section of the house was locked at the time, said Nalchhiti Police Station officer-in-charge Ariful Alam. Witnesses said two unidentified individuals entered the house through a dining room window and fled the scene shortly afterwards. Additional Superintendent of Police SM Bayazid, along with other senior police officials, visited the scene this afternoon. \"A local witness saw two people fleeing through the dining room window. Since the main rooms were locked, nothing happened there. We cannot confirm whether anything was taken from the dining area until the house owner informs us,\" the OC said. Hadi's cousin, Sirajul Islam, said the burglars took advantage of the house being unoccupied. \"They broke the window and entered the house. We still do not know if any belongings are missing,\" he said. Sharif Osman Hadi was shot yesterday at around 2:15pm in front of a water tanker in Dhaka's Bijoynagar area. He is currently in critical condition and remains on life support at Evercare Hospital in the capital.",

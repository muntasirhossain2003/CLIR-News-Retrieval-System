    "body": "BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman yesterday said his party will prioritise ensuring law and order and tackling corruption if voted to power. \"Those who will form the government after winning the election must first ensure one thing, and that is the rule of law. I think our foremost effort should be to ensure this with all our strength,\" he said while virtually addressing a discussion programme organised by BNP to exchange views with professionals and noted citizens. The programme was held at a city hotel, with BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir presiding. Tarique said if the next government can ensure the rule of law and maintain the law and order, there will be a strong possibility that many problems will start to ease, and then it will be possible to move forward with other necessary work. Referring to the long period of what he described as autocratic rule in the past, Tarique said unhealthy practices had developed in different sectors of society, where people received benefits and privileges they did not deserve. \"This has almost become a habit over time. So this situation and this mindset must be changed. In simple words, corruption must be firmly brought under control,\" he said. Presenting his party's plans for the country's development and people's welfare, he said, \"The right decision is not always the popular decision. Popular decisions can be taken easily, but the correct decision is not always popular.\" He stressed that despite these challenges, taking correct and responsible decisions will be essential to meet people's expectations and build a stable, secure and accountable state.",

    "body": "Nepalese officials on Wednesday inked a landmark agreement with representatives of the Gen Z movement, whose September uprising toppled the Himalayan nation's government. The agreement lays out measures aimed at curbing corruption, strengthening governance and provisions for electoral and constitutional reforms. It also commits the government to address the demands of families of those killed or wounded during the uprising and adds to the mandate of the commission investigating the events. The demonstrations on September, initially triggered by anger over a brief government ban on social media, were spearheaded by protesters under the loose \"Gen Z\" umbrella title. They were fuelled by deeper frustration over economic hardship and corruption. At a ceremony in the capital Kathmandu, the room clapped as interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki and Bhoj Bikram Thapa, who represented those who were killed or injured during the protest, signed the agreement.",

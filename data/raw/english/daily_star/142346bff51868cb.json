    "body": "Government today announced that Sharif Osman Hadi, an independent MP aspirant for Dhaka-8 and spokesperson for Inqilab Moncho, will be flown to Singapore tomorrow by air ambulance for advanced treatment. The decision was taken today following an emergency call held on the instructions of Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus. Participants in the meeting included Cultural Affairs Adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, chief adviser's special assistant for health affairs Prof Dr Md Sayedur Rahman, Evercare Hospital specialist Dr Zafor Iqbal, and Hadi's brother Omar Bin Hadi. Hadi, a leader of the July uprising, was shot in broad daylight in Dhaka's Paltan area on Friday, leaving him critically injured just a day after the Election Commission announced the schedule for the 13th national election. Over the past two days, the government contacted several hospitals in Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia regarding Hadi's treatment. After consultations with Evercare Hospital's specialist team and discussions with family members, the matter was placed before the chief adviser. Prof Dr Sayedur Rahman said Hadi's condition is currently stable and unchanged. All arrangements for the transfer -- including a medical air ambulance, a medical team, and travel logistics -- have been completed, while necessary preparations have also been made at the Accident and Emergency Department of Singapore General Hospital. The government will bear all expenses related to Hadi's treatment. Chief Adviser Yunus has instructed the authorities concerned to monitor the treatment process round the clock and has sought prayers from the public for Hadi's speedy recovery.",

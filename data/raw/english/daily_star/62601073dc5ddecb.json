    "body": "Paramount launched an all-cash tender offer Monday to acquire Warner Bros Discovery for $30 per share, challenging a previously announced deal between WBD and Netflix. The offer values the entertainment giant at $108.4 billion and represents a 139 per cent premium over WBD's September stock price of $12.54, Paramount said in a statement that called Netflix's bid \"inferior and uncertain.\" \"WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer,\" said David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount.",

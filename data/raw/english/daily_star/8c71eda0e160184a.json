    "title": "Narayanganj city Awami League VP Rabiul Hossain arrested",
    "body": "Police arrested Rabiul Hossain, vice-president of Narayanganj city unit of the Awami League, from his residence this evening. Additional Superintendent of Police (Crime) Tarek Al Mehdi confirmed the arrest, saying, \"A team from Sadar Model Police Station arrested him.\" Officer-in-Charge of Narayanganj Sadar Model Police Station Mohammad Abdul Halim added that a regular case had been filed against Rabiul at the station and that he has been arrested in that case, with further details to be disclosed later. Rabiul was known as a close associate of former Awami League lawmaker from Narayanganj-4 constituency, Shamim Osman. Neighbours said Rabiul, like many other Awami League leaders, went into hiding after the July uprising but had recently returned home. The arrest came just hours after Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury instructed police to bring \"criminals of the Awami League\" under the law, even if no cases had been filed against them. Earlier in the day, police arrested Azizul Islam, general secretary of Duptara union Awami League in Araihazar upazila and a former union parishad chairman. He was produced before a court in a case filed under the Explosives Act linked to last year's anti-discrimination student movement.",

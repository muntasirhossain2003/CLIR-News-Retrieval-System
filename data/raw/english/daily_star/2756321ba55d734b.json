    "body": "BNP-nominated candidate Nazmul Mostafa Amin for the Chattogram-15 constituency has been fined Tk 50,000 for violating the electoral code of conduct. The fine was imposed around 4:30pm today by Executive Magistrate Maung Asen, who is responsible for ensuring compliance with the electoral code of conduct. Confirming the matter, Maung Asen, also assistant commissioner (land) of Lohagara upazila, told The Daily Star that Nazmul reached Lohagara with a large motorcade from Chattogram via Satkania upazila to attend a programme. When the motorcade reached the Battali area, a mobile court stopped it and fined Nazmul under Section 9 of the Code of Conduct for Political Parties and Candidates, 2025, citing a violation of Section 27, said the magistrate, who led the mobile court team. Witnesses said Nazmul was standing through the sunroof of an SUV, surrounded by around 100 vehicles, including motorcycles, SUVs and private cars.\" According to the Chattogram district administration, this is the first enforcement of a fine for violating the electoral code since the election schedule was announced. On December 4, the BNP announced Nazmul as its candidate for the Chattogram-15 (Satkania–Lohagara) constituency. On December 11, the Election Commission announced the schedule for the 13th National Parliamentary Election. According to the announced schedule, voting will be held on February 12.",

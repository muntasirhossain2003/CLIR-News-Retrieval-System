    "body": "Students Against Discrimination (SAD) today called on the Election Commission (EC) to prevent candidates who participated in the 12th National Parliamentary Election from contesting the upcoming election. A delegation of SAD, the organisation behind last year's July movement, made the demand during a meeting with Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin at the EC headquarters in Dhaka. After the meeting, SAD President Rifat Rashid told reporters that the organisation submitted a legal notice to the EC regarding the matter. \"We have issued legal notices to prevent those who were candidates in the 2024 dummy election from running again. While participants of the July movement are facing life-threatening risks, fugitives sitting abroad are planning conspiracies,\" he said. Rifat Rashid added that in response to the conspiracies of these fugitive leaders, Students Against Discrimination will take a hard-line stance. \"The Awami League stole votes because they had none. Political parties are now restless to bow to Awami League for votes,\" he claimed. SAD's chief coordinator, Hasib Al Imran, said, \"Many were elected MPs in the 2024 election, even from outside the Awami League. They supported the mass killings during the July movement. Therefore, anyone who was a candidate in that dummy election should not be allowed to contest the 2026 election. To ensure they cannot participate under any circumstance, we have also served a legal notice.\"",

    "body": "Pakistani Taliban militants stormed a security checkpoint in Pakistan's northwestern border area with Afghanistan, killing six soldiers and wounding four others, a government official said yesterday. Pakistan has faced a surge in militant attacks along its border regions since the Taliban authorities retook control in Kabul in 2021. It accuses Afghanistan of harbouring the insurgents. Late Monday, more than a dozen armed men attacked the checkpoint, leading to a heavy exchange of fire in Kurram. \"Six security personnel were martyred and four were injured, while two militants were also killed in the fighting,\" the government official posted in Kurram told AFP.",

    "body": "Israel launched a series of strikes on southern Lebanon yesterday, Lebanese state media reported, with the Israeli army saying it hit a Hezbollah training centre and other targets. Despite a November 2024 ceasefire that was supposed to end more than a year of hostilities between Israel and the Iran-backed group, Israel has kept up strikes on Lebanon and maintains troops in five areas of the country's south. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported \"a series of (Israeli) raids targeting the Iqlim al-Tuffah region\" near the towns of Azza, Rumin and Jbaa, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of the border with Israel. \"A number of houses were damaged\" in JBaa, the NNA added. The Israeli military said it had struck \"infrastructure belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in several areas in southern Lebanon\". According to the military \"a training and qualification compound used by Hezbollah's Radwan Force\" was hit, as were \"military structures and a launch site belonging to Hezbollah\".",

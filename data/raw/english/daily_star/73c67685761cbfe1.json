To mark the country's 54 years of independence, 54 paratroopers from the Bangladesh Army, Navy, and Air Force performed a national flag-bearing skydive. Prof Yunus also witnessed the separate fly-past and aerobatic display. He also enjoyed a special Victory Day band show there. Later, the chief adviser exchanged greetings with the 54 paratroopers and took part in a photo session with them. The nation is celebrating Victory Day with elaborate programmes, paying homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country during the Liberation War. On this day in 1971, Bangladesh was liberated as an independent country after the Pakistani occupation forces surrendered following a bloody nine-month war.",

    "body": "The Election Commission (EC) on Monday night issued a clarification regarding remarks made by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin on the shooting of Sharif Osman Hadi, spokesperson of Inqilab Moncho and an aspiring candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency. The clarification was released by EC's Public Relations Department after 9:00pm, with the commission noting that the statement was meant to dispel any misunderstanding surrounding the CEC's earlier comments. In its explanation, the EC said the CEC's intention was to convey that the attack on Osman Hadi would not be able to disrupt the upcoming national election. Earlier in the day, while responding to a question at an event in Dhaka's Gulshan area, Nasir had said the law and order situation had not deteriorated, describing the shooting as \"an isolated incident\". \"Where has law and order deteriorated? From time to time, one or two incidents of murder or violence occur. Similar incidents happened earlier, including the killing of Ahsanullah Master,\" he said, urging people not to draw broader conclusions from the attack.",

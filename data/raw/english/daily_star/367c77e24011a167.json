    "body": "US President Donald Trump said he was planning to \"make a phone call\" on Wednesday about the renewed clashes between Thailand and Cambodia over their contested border, which have prompted evacuations. During a rally speech to supporters in the northeastern US state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Trump listed various conflicts he has become involved with diplomatically, concluding with: \"And I hate to say this, one named Cambodia-Thailand, that it started up today.\" \"Tomorrow, I have to make a phone call, and I think they'll get it,\" he continued. \"Who else could say, 'I'm going to make a phone call and stop a war of two very powerful countries'?\" Trump co-signed a truce between a Cambodia and Thailand in October during a visit to Asia. The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia centers on a century-old disagreement over borders mapped during France's colonial rule in the region, with both sides claiming a smattering of boundary temples.",

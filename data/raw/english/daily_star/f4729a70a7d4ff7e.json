    "body": "Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has extended greetings and congratulations to the Election Commission following the announcement of schedule for the 13th National Parliamentary Election and the referendum on the July National Charter. In a message, Yunus described the announcement as a significant milestone in Bangladesh's democratic journey. \"After the historic mass uprising, the country is now moving toward a new path. This election and referendum will consolidate that trajectory, prioritise the will of the people, and further strengthen the foundation of a new Bangladesh,\" he said. He expressed confidence that the Election Commission would fulfil its constitutional responsibilities independently, impartially, and with professionalism. He added that the interim government would provide all necessary assistance to ensure the election and referendum are conducted in a festive, participatory, and fair manner. Calling upon political parties, candidates, media, civil society, and citizens, Yunus urged that the election and referendum be embraced as initiatives of national unity. He stressed that respect for differing opinions, peaceful conduct, and democratic behaviour would help stabilise the country. \"Bangladesh now stands at the threshold of a new future. Through your active participation and responsible conduct, we will succeed in building a modern, just, and prosperous state -- this is my firm conviction,\" Yunus said.",

    "body": "War of words between members of the Pakistan's ruling PML-N and the PTI continued yesterday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that \"things have reached a point of no return\", while PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that \"better sense should prevail\". In a press conference held yesterday, Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, \"We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy; however, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance.\" \"All doors to talks are now closed,\" Wali said. PTI Chairman Gohar, speaking to the media yesterday, objected to the resolution, warning that the government was attempting to \"pitch federating units against each other.\" On Tuesday, the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution to ban incarcerated PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his party for being \"anti-state\". \"You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?\" the PTI chairman asked. \"I said it to them yesterday as well. This is not business, you can not minus one, and be left with another. \"If we are removed, then they will not be left either.\" \"If this continues, then things will get out of control within a month,\" he added.",

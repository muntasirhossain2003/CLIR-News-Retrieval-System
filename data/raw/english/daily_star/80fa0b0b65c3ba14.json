The observances began at sunrise yesterday with a 31-gun salute at the Liberation War Memorial. Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) Mayor Shahadat Hossain was the first to lay a wreath at the martyr's monument. He was followed by divisional and city dignitaries, including Divisional Commissioner Dr Md Ziauddin, Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Zahidul Islam Mia, Chattogram Metropolitan Police Commissioner Hasib Aziz, Chattogram Range DIG Md Ahsan Habib Palash, and Chattogram Superintendent of Police Md Nazir Ahmed Khan. Later, people from various segments of society paid their respects by placing flowers at the monument. Attendees carried banners, placards, and the red-and-green flag of Bangladesh, uniting in a single confluence of respect. Freedom fighters and representatives from political parties, social, and cultural organisations also offered their tributes. The freedom fighters risked their lives to free the country. To protect the sovereignty of this independent nation, everyone must remain united. In the morning, the city corporation organised a reception ceremony at the Theatre Institute Chattogram to honour 110 freedom fighters currently living in the district. Mayor Shahadat Hossain handed over crests, certificates of honour, and financial stipends to freedom fighters and the families of those who sacrificed their lives in the 1971 Liberation War. In his address as the chief guest, Mayor Shahadat said, \"The valiant freedom fighters are the nation's finest children. We attained an independent Bangladesh through their sacrifice. We are proud and delighted to host this reception today.\" \"The Liberation War of 1971 was fought with a dream of establishing equality, justice, human dignity, and democracy. The freedom fighters never thought of stipends or personal gain. They risked their lives to free the country. To protect the sovereignty of this independent nation, everyone must remain united.\"",

    "body": "At least eight people were injured yesterday when police broke up a demonstration by leftist protesters demanding release of final results from Honduras's election, authorities said. Outgoing President Xiomara Castro condemned the operation in which protesters from her party were removed from a camp set up in front of the National Electoral Council building. Images shared on social media showed a man with a bloodied face, as well as tents, mattresses, and other objects scattered on the ground. Tegucigalpa Mayor Jorge Aldana told AFP that eight people had been injured but were recovering. \"They treated us like criminals,\" Aldana said. The Central American country has not yet certified results from the November 30 election in which Nasry Asfura, a 67-year-old right-wing businessman backed by US President Donald Trump, holds a razor-thin lead over Salvador Nasralla, a 72-year-old fellow conservative. Castro has accused Trump of election interference and the candidate from her leftist camp, Rixi Moncada, has called for the election to be annulled. The latest preliminary results show Asfura in the lead with 40.54 percent of the vote, about 43,000 votes ahead of the center-right Nasralla, who has 39.19 percent of the vote. Trailing far behind in third place with 19.29 percent of the vote is Rixi Moncada, of the ruling leftist LIBRE party. The tally sheets to be reviewed in the special hand count could easily flip the result standings of the two frontrunners. While voting on election day itself was calm, the subsequent process of tallying and reporting the ballots has been marred by chaos and confusion.",

    "title": "Small boat migrant crossings resume in English Channel",
    "body": "Migrants resumed attempts to cross the English Channel to reach Britain on Saturday, four weeks after the last small boat arrived. An interior minister spokesperson condemned the crossings as \"shameful\", adding: \"The British people deserve better.\" The recent pause in crossings -- believed to be due to poor weather conditions -- is the longest in seven years. Before the weekend, no vessels had reached the southern English coast for 28 days, according to interior ministry figures. Migrants last arrived on the south coast from northern France on November 14. Figures for how many arrived on Saturday, when a number of small boats were seen in the Channel, will be released later. The number of migrants taking the perilous route to the UK has become a major political issue in Britain. The crossings are helping fuel the popularity of Reform, led by anti-immigration firebrand Nigel Farage, which has led Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party by double-digit margins in opinion polls for most of this year.",

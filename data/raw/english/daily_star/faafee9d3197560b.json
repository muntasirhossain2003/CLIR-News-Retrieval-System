    "body": "Sharif Osman Hadi, a prospective independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency and spokesperson of Inqilab Moncho, was shot this afternoon while travelling by rickshaw in Dhaka's Paltan area, according to witnesses and law enforcement officials. Witnesses said Hadi was heading towards Bijoynagar on a rickshaw when two helmet-wearing men on a motorcycle opened fire on him in front of the Baitus Salam Jame Mosque before fleeing the scene. The area was later cordoned off as members of law enforcement agencies, including police, Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) and Detective Branch (DB), began investigating the incident. CCTV footage was collected from nearby buildings. Footage shows Hadi on a battery-run rickshaw when a motorcycle approached from the side and the pillion rider fired at him. Harun-ur-Rashid, deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police's Motijheel division, told journalists that police are working to identify the attackers, though details remain limited at this stage. Sakib Hossen, a security guard at DR Tower near the scene, said he was inside the building when the gunshots rang out. \"After hearing the sound, I rushed outside and saw a rickshaw carrying him away. Blood was dripping onto the street,\" he said.",

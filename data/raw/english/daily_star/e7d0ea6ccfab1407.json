    "body": "Jatiya Party, led by GM Quader, has taken the primary decision to participate in the upcoming 13th national parliamentary election, though the decision may be reconsidered after assessing the overall situation. Jatiya Party Secretary General Shameem Haider Patwary made the announcement today at a press conference held at the party's central office in Kakrail. \"Our nomination form distribution has begun today. We hope the Election Commission will hold an inclusive election with the participation of all. Otherwise, the country's crisis will not be resolved,\" he said. \"Law and order had never deteriorated to such an extent two months ahead of any election. We hope the government will ensure a level playing field,\" he said. He alleged that certain quarters are attempting to undermine the spirit of 1971 and distort history. He further claimed that over the past year, the judiciary has not been able to function independently and that mob violence has become widespread. \"Opponents are being harassed through false and fabricated cases,\" Shameem said, adding that even after securing bail, individuals are being arrested again from jail gates. As an example, he cited former Jatiya Party MP Golam Kibria, who has repeatedly been arrested from jail gates and implicated in new cases despite obtaining bail multiple times.",

An ambulance carrying Hadi reached Evercare Hospital around 8:05 pm, sources at the hospital told The Daily Star. Earlier, around 7:36 pm, the ambulance left Dhaka Medical College Hospital for Evercare. Brig Gen Md Asaduzzaman, director of DMCH, also confirmed the development to The Daily Star. Police and witnesses said Hadi was heading towards Bijoynagar on a rickshaw around 2:25pm. Footage shows Hadi on a battery-run rickshaw when a motorcycle approached from the side and the pillion rider fired at him. In a Facebook post at 11:52 am today, Hadi wrote, \"Since I don't have any posters or festoons in Dhaka-8, there's no pressure of them being torn down either. Jumma Mubarak from in front of the ACC.\" Hadi announced his candidacy in a Facebook post on September 14. His platform -- Inqilab Moncho -- was formed on August 13 last year.",

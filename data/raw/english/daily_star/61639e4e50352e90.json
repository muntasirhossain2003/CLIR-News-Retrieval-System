    "body": "Police have arrested the house help accused in the mother-daughter murder case in Mohammadpur from Jhalakathi today. \"In connection with the mother and daughter murder in Mohammadpur, the house help has been arrested from Jhalakathi,\" Mohammadpur Police Station Officer-in-Charge Mezbah Uddin told The Daily Star. He said further details would be shared later at a press briefing. Laila Afroz, 48, and Nafisa Nawal Binte Aziz, 15, wife and daughter of school teacher AZ Azizul Islam, respectively, were murdered on Monday (December 8) inside their home on Shahjahan Road allegedly by a part-time house help who identified herself as Ayesha to the family. After the murder, prime suspect house help went at large. Law enforcers struggled to trace her as she left almost no digital footprint. She did not give her original name and actual address to her employer, making the investigation challenging. Her face was not captured clearly by the building's CCTV cameras either as she was always wearing a burqa. Different agencies, including Rab and detectives, were hunting for her. The house help allegedly made away with a mobile phone, a laptop, gold jewellery and cash after the killings. Laila Afroz suffered around 30 stab wounds, while her teenage daughter endured at least six, according to police and morgue officials. The killer stabbed mostly at their throats and necks, officials at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College morgue said after completing the autopsies. AZ Azizul Islam filed a case against the house help in connection with the double murder at night on the same day.",

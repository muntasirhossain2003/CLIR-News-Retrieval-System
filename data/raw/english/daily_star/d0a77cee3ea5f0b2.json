    "body": "A Facebook post by a Rajshahi University (RU) teacher referring to women's rights and education pioneer Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain as \"kafir\" and \"murtad\" has drawn sharp criticism on social media. On Tuesday, Khandker Mahmudul Hasan, associate professor at the Department of Physics, shared the post from his personal profile, writing, \"Today is the birthday of murtad kafir Begum Rokeya.\" In reaction to the post, Rucsu Debate and Literature Editor Imran Laskar said Begum Rokeya's writings reflected reformist thoughts shaped by the socio-economic realities of her time. \"If anyone labels her based on religious interpretation, that remains a personal view and should be discussed by qualified scholars,\" he noted. Jahin Biswas Esha, joint general secretary of Chhatra Dal's RU unit, said such comments demean the entire womankind. Contacted, Khandker Mahmudul Hasan said his post reflected his personal religious interpretation and that a detailed explanation was included in the original post. December 9 is observed nationwide as Begum Rokeya Day.",

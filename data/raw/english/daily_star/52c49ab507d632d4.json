    "body": "Fifty-four years after independence, many stories of the Liberation War remain untold. The 10th part of this 12-part series turns to the indigenous fighters of Bangladesh -- from the plains of Barendra to the hills of the Chittagong Hill Tracts -- whose courage, sacrifices and resistance shaped the war, but whose names and contributions have long remained on the margins of official history. The day before, the Mukti Bahini captured Pateshwari and positioned themselves at Baghbandha under the leadership of EPR Nayek Ukya Ching Marma. Sensing their presence, the Pakistan forces opened heavy fire, but the freedom fighters remained unflinching. On the morning of November 14, Ukya Ching conducted reconnaissance with Indian officers and set traps for a surprise attack. The attack began at 8:00pm, and with precise planning and the use of LMGs and grenades, the Mukti Bahini overwhelmed the Pakistanis, who fled under the cover of darkness, liberating Bhurungamari. For his exceptional valor, Ukya Ching was conferred the Bir Bikram title, the only indigenous man to receive the gallantry award. This was not his only operation. From the very beginning of the war, he displayed bravery in one battle after another across Sector 6. Notable among these were the battles at Hathibandha, Pakhihura, Rowmari, Rayganj, and Chowdhuryhat, according to Ukya Ching's memoir written in the daily Prothom Alo in 2005. He died in 2014. From the plains to the hills, indigenous men and women stood shoulder to shoulder with their Bangalee brothers and sisters in the Liberation War as fighters, organisers and informants. Though the exact number of fighters from indigenous communities has never officially been recorded, their contributions have been documented in several books, including \"Muktijuddhe Adibasi\" by Ayub Hossain and Charu Haque, and \"Adibasi Muktijoddha\" by Tapon Kumar Dey. According to these books, hundreds of indigenous youths from the Oraon, Munda, Kora, Kol, Mahali and Rajuar communities of Rajshahi's Barendra region and Chapainawabganj joined the war at the call of indigenous leader Sagram Majhi. From Rangpur and Dinajpur to Sylhet and Netrokona, indigenous men and women from both plains and hills fought as combatants, spies and organisers. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts, resistance took an extraordinary turn when an indigenous king opened his palace to refugees and freedom fighters, transforming royal privilege into a weapon of war. In search of their stories, this correspondent travelled across several districts, including Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Khagrachhari, Mymensingh and Netrokona, and interviewed at least 40 indigenous freedom fighters, elderly residents, and members of royal families. Their accounts tell stories of the valour and sacrifice of the indigenous communities, though most remain unrecognised. Liberation War researcher Afsan Chowdhury says, \"During the war, Pakistanis inflicted greater damage on indigenous peoples than on Bengalis. From the very beginning of the war, indigenous communities became one of the primary targets of the Pakistani Army. Yet, even after being completely dispossessed, indigenous people sacrificed everything and took part in the war. Far less work has been done on the contributions of indigenous peoples to the Liberation War than was necessary -- almost none at all.\" Sagram Majhi was born in Kendubuna Para village in Godagari union of Rajshahi's Godagari upazila. Today, it is known as Sagrampur. Elected to the provincial assembly in the 1954 Jukto Front election, Sagram was known among indigenous people as a key organiser of the war. From Sagrampur alone, at least 25 indigenous youths joined the war; none are alive today. Indigenous youths from almost every village in nearby Gogram, Rishikul and Matikata unions also took part. One such fighter is Narayan Chandra Murari, 72, of the Munda community from Bottoli village under Gogram union. In April 1971, local Razakars looted Bottoli. To save his life, Narayan, then 17 or 18, fled to India with others. \"In India, we took shelter at the refugee camp in Hatinagar Colony of Baharampur. We were given ration cards. A few days later, Sagram babu came to the camp, gathered the youths and said, 'Everyone must now go to war. There is no other way to survive'.\" Santals like Naika Kislu, 78, from Mohammadpur village of Tanore upazila, recalled how Sagram went to every camp enrolling indigenous people for training. \"After training at Gourbagan Youth Camp, I fought in the Mehedipur sub-sector.\" Among the Santal fighters, platoon commanders Bishwanath Tudu and Chompae Soren made significant contributions. From the Oraon community, the lone platoon commander was Rampada Oraon, now 83. He told The Daily Star that his platoon, having around 30 fighters, fought battles in Poragram, Rohanpur, Shibganj, Radhakantapur, Godagari, Tanore and Mohonpur. \"We launched three attacks on the Tanore and Mohanpur police stations. In the final three-pronged assault on Tanore on November 29, the station was liberated on November 30. One indigenous freedom fighter was martyred, and another was seriously wounded,\" he said. Shortly after, Pakistani soldiers and Razakars looted and burned their villages, and after independence, fighters returned to destroyed homes. According to the Liberation War Affairs ministry, 62 indigenous people from Godagari thana in Rajshahi are officially recognised, though the actual number is believed to be higher. One major front for indigenous resistance was Rangpur. According to \"Bangladesh Independence War: Sector-Based History, Sector 6\", after massacres in Rangpur city, the cantonment and EPR headquarters on March 25-26, Santal leader Joyram Soren and Oraon leader Budu Oraon met political leaders Sheikh Amzad Hossain, Mujibur Rahman Master and others. They decided to capture Rangpur Cantonment on March 28. Thousands of Santal and Oraon fighters gathered with bows, arrows and traditional weapons. As they marched towards the cantonment, Pakistani soldiers opened indiscriminate machine-gun fire from 10 jeeps. The Ghaghot river ran red with the blood of hundreds; the wounded were killed with bayonets. Freedom fighter Shamsuddin Azad, who took part in the operation, told The Daily Star, \"Thousands of Santal and Oraon people came from Baldipukur in Mithapukur and gathered with us at Nisbetganj, armed with bows and arrows, to seize the cantonment. \"Even indigenous women joined. The Ghaghot River still carries the blood-soaked history of the indigenous people.\" Persecution across northern Bengal intensified afterward, forcing over 30,000 indigenous people to flee the country, according to the book. Today, a memorial sculpture of Joyram Soren stands at the Rangpur Cantonment entrance. Meanwhile, over 100 people from the Santal, Munda, Kora, Oraon, Mahali and Turi communities of Ranipukur union in Biral upazila of Dinajpur district joined the war. They trained at Shivbari camp in Gangarampur under retired EPR soldier George Das, fighting first under sub-sectors and later under George Bahini. From the endangered Kora community of Haljay village, at least 14 men joined. Only one, Kina Kora, is alive. \"To stop the Pakistanis from moving freely, we decided to destroy the bridge in November. Under George da's leadership, 20 of us planted 40 kilograms of explosives and blew it up,\" he told The Daily Star. \"Muktijuddhe Adibasi\" documents how indigenous leader Neelmoni Chattopadhyay formed a force of 1,200 fighters from the Manipuri, Khasi, Baraik and Rajbongshi communities in Moulvibazar. Manipuri freedom fighter Mantri Kumar Sinha, 78, said, they trained at the Loharban training centre, and fought as part of Company #6, first in Khowai and later in Kamalpur. Among the Manipuri fighters, Girindra Singh, group commander L Harendra Singh, section commander M Monmohon Singh, Bireshwar Singh, Nilchan Dutt and Abdul Hamid Manipuri showed exceptional bravery, according to the book. The book also documents the story of Manipuri martyr Girindra Singh, who planted mines around Magurchhara and was captured, tortured and killed during reconnaissance for the Madhabpur operation. In Sylhet's tea gardens, over 600 indigenous people were killed. One massacre was the May 1 killing of 47 workers in Sreemangal's Bharaundra Tea Garden, according to the book. Soldiers killed Nakula Hazra first, then shot around 60 workers near the Kali temple, witnesses said. Survivor Bijoy Hazra said, \"The Punjabis slaughtered innocent people like birds. My father and brother were among the martyrs. Another brother survived despite being shot.\" In the Chittagong Hill Tracts, while Chakma and Bomang royal families opposed the war, Mong king Mongpru Sain stood apart. He opened the Mong Palace and royal granary to refugees and fighters, handed over his weapons and vehicles, and turned the palace into a shelter and medical centre. Hundreds of Marma and Tripura youths joined his call, while he himself fought on the front lines, notably in the Battle of Akhaura. Freedom fighter Chai Uri Mong said, \"In May-June, the king went camp to camp urging indigenous people to join. \"I fought in the Manughat sub-sector. In August, we attacked the Pakistani headquarters at Andharmanik, killing a Pakistani captain and a Junior Commissioned Officer. On September 9, an ambush on a Pakistani boat convoy at Panchhari left 25 Pakistani soldiers dead.\" Meanwhile, despite the Chakma king's opposition, many Chakma fighters made heroic contributions. KK Roy of the royal family joined the war, while Ramaniranjan Chakma was martyred in Ramgarh, and EPR sepoy Hemranjan Chakma in Bogura, according to the book \"Muktijuddhe Adabasi\". At the war's outset, provincial assembly member Manabendra Narayan Larma began organising the Jumma people. Among the three women awarded the Bir Protik for heroic contributions during and after the Liberation War, Kankan Heninchita, a Khasi tribal woman, was the only indigenous recipient. Her story, along with those of other women fighters, is documented in \"Bangladesher Shadhinota Shongram O Nari Muktijoddha-Volume 1\" by Meherunessa Mary. Before the war, she was married to Majid Khan, a Pakistani EPR soldier who deserted during the war. Later, her sister and brother-in-law were martyred by Pakistani forces. While searching for her husband, Kankan was detained on suspicion of being a Mukti Bahini spy and brutally tortured. After tracing Majid Khan, the Pakistanis forced her to work as a spy inside Mukti Bahini camps. But having lost her family and dignity, Kankan decided to take revenge. She contacted Captain Helal Uddin, commander of the Laxmipur camp, and became a spy for the Mukti Bahini instead. Using the trust of Pakistani soldiers, she stole weapons and ammunition and delivered them to freedom fighter camps. In August, despite great risk, she personally carried explosives and mines for the operation to destroy the Jardia Bridge in Sunamganj. Based on her intelligence, the Mukti Bahini carried out attacks and fought at least 20 successful battles, including Basrai Tengra Tila, Betirgaon–Nurpur, Teblai, Mahabbatpur, and Silairpar. Indigenous women served both on the front lines and in medical services. Two Garo freedom fighters, Sandhya Rani Sangma and Veronica Sangma from Mymensingh and Netrokona, joined the war after training at the nursing centre of the Joyramkura Christian Missionary Hospital in Haluaghat. Speaking to this correspondent, Sandhya said, \"We began working as nurses at the Bagmara Field Hospital under Sector 11 in May, later moving to Bakshiganj in Jamalpur in October. We set up tents and treated wounded fighters amid mortar shelling by razakars, which we narrowly survived.\" Rakhine freedom fighter Princha Kheyo also worked as a nurse while engaging in espionage, and despite being captured and severely tortured by Pakistani forces, she did not reveal any information, the book noted.",

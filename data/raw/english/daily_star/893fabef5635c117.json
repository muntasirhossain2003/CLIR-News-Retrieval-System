    "body": "BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said those who opposed Bangladesh's independence in 1971 are once again raising their heads. The struggle for democracy would gain momentum with the return of the party's acting Chairman, Tarique Rahman, on December 25, Fakhrul said after paying homage at the grave of BNP founder Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. \"Today, the enemies of independence, those who stood against independence in 1971, are trying to rise again. The freedom-loving people of Bangladesh, who believe in independence and democracy, will foil all their conspiracies and keep the country's independence and sovereignty intact. Democracy will be established,\" Fakhrul said. The BNP leader further said, \"The war that began with the declaration of independence achieved its final victory in December (in 1971). That is why this day is important to us.\" He added, \"We have taken an oath at this grave that our struggle to protect the country's independence will continue. We have pledged that the struggle we have carried out for democracy in Bangladesh will go on. We will surely establish a democratic state.\" Fakhrul said he also wished for the speedy recovery of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia.",

The meeting began around 11:40am, BNP media cell member Sayrul Kabir Khan confirmed. Sources said the discussion centred on the prevailing law and order situation in the country following the announcement of the schedule for the upcoming national election. Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin in a televised address on Thursday announced the schedule for the 13th national election and the referendum on the July charter, both to be held on February 12. 'Anti-democratic force, carried out attack on Hadi' After emerging from the meeting with the CA, Salahuddin said the attack on Hadi was carried out by forces opposed to democracy and intent on preventing the upcoming national election. \"Those who do not want the election, who refuse to see the democratic path, and who are against democracy... they attacked Hadi. They are present both inside and outside the country,\" he said after meeting the chief adviser. \"I do not consider this an isolated incident. The day after the election schedule was announced, an attempt was made on an aspirant. The nature of the attack clearly indicates that it was the work of a professional assassin.\"",

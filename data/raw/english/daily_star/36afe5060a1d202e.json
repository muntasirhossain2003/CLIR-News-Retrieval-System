    "body": "Saying that the country is going through a severe crisis, BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman today said that a conspiracy to disrupt the election has already begun. The party or individuals who had threatened to disrupt the election are now working to destabilise the country, he said, urging all political parties to unite. He condemned the shooting of Sharif Osman Hadi, an aspiring candidate for Dhaka-8. \"At different times, various individuals and members of different organisations openly threatened that they would not allow the expected election in February,\" Tarique said at a program, joining virtually from London. He made the remarks at the closing session of BNP's six-day 'Plan to Build the Country' workshop in the capital. \"A party, group, or some individuals have openly threatened to obstruct the election. They are working to destroy the peace and stability of this country,\" said Tarique, \"As supporters of democracy, it is our duty to strongly protest this incident,\" he added. \"Those who want to destroy the independence, sovereignty, and stability of this country have already begun their conspiracy, which is evident from this incident,\" he said. Tarique further said, \"If we have to take a stand against the injustice done to Hadi and Ershadullah, we must establish democracy at any cost.\" On November 5, BNP candidate from Chattogram-8 constituency Ershad Ullah was injured in an attack by armed miscreants during campaigning.",

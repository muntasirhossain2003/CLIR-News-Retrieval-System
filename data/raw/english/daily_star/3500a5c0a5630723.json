    "body": "The Election Commission yesterday issued a circular on candidate eligibility and disqualification for the next national polls, adding a provision barring anyone from contesting if a formal charge has been filed against them at the International Crimes Tribunals. According to the circular, if a formal charge is submitted against any person under Section 9(1) of the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973, that individual will be disqualified under Section 20 of the same law from being elected as a member of parliament or from continuing in office as an MP. The EC also issued a letter on maintaining the electoral environment during the pre-election period, stating that, as per the announced schedule, the election will be held on February 12. In this context, under the Political Parties and Candidates' Code of Conduct 2025 for parliamentary elections, election campaigning may be conducted from three weeks before polling until 48 hours before the start of voting, the letter said. On Thursday, the EC issued another circular following the announcement of the election schedule and the referendum. It included a gazette notification of the twin votes, the appointment of returning officers and assistant returning officers, and other election-related matters. The circular cited candidate qualifications and disqualifications as laid out in Article 66 of the Constitution and Article 12 of the Representation of the People Order, 1972. However, it did not mention Section 20(C) of the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973. This provision was added through an ordinance issued in October.",

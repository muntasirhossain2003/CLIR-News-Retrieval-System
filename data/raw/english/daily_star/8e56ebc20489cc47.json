    "body": "Dhaka University's pro-Awami League teachers' panel, 'Neel Dal', has strongly condemned the alleged assault on teachers inside the Social Sciences Faculty teachers' lounge on Thursday. In a statement issued today, the organisation demanded the cancellation of studentship of those involved in the attack and urged the university administration to take strict measures to end \"mob violence\" on campus. According to the press release, Prof Zeenat Huda, Prof AKM Jamal Uddin, Prof Mohammad Azmal Hossain Bhuiyan, and Prof Touhida Rashid had submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor's office seeking an end to what they described as the mistreatment of suspended teachers, students, officers, and employees. The statement alleged that shortly after leaving the lounge, the teachers were attacked by a group led by AB Zubair, social welfare secretary of Ducsu, along with another individual named Mosaddek. \"Despite attempts to pacify them, they acted aggressively and began attacking the teachers indiscriminately,\" the statement said. It said that the assaulted teachers repeatedly called the proctor and assistant proctors during the incident but received no response. The statement added that even after the attack, neither the vice-chancellor nor the proctorial team contacted the victims. The organisation further alleged that several newspapers and online portals published \"biased reports\" shielding those responsible and obscuring the actual incident. It criticised the university administration for failing to take steps to prevent mob violence and questioned its ability to ensure the safety of teachers.",

    "body": "A joint secretary of the Planning Commission was held hostage inside her official car by her driver, who demanded Tk six lakh. The incident lasted nearly four hours, from morning until noon, as the driver drove around different parts of Dhaka before being detained by law enforcers at the Planning Commission. A case has been filed with Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police Station over abduction and extortion, confirmed Akkas Ali, assistant commissioner (Tejgaon Zone) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police. The joint secretary, Maksuda Hossain, works in the Programming Division of the Planning Commission. The driver, Abdul Awal, 40, had been driving her official vehicle for the past two months and previously worked for another joint secretary at the commission. Maksuda said she left her Dhanmondi residence around 8:15am for her office, but the driver diverted the car near the China-Bangladesh Friendship Conference Centre and drove through Bijoy Sarani, Mohakhali, Banani, and Airport Road without explanation. Sensing danger, she informed a colleague. When she attempted to call the national emergency service 999, the driver snatched her mobile phone, locked the car doors, and drove towards Hemayetpur in Savar via Uttara's Diabari and Baribadh, before roaming different parts of Dhaka and eventually returning to the Planning Commission around noon. Maksuda said the driver did not respond to her questions but later demanded Tk six lakh for his mother's treatment, initially asking for Tk 50,000. She told him she had no money with her and would pay after reaching the office, where police detained him.",

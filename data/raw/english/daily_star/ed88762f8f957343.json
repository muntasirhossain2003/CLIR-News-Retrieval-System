    "body": "BNP Standing Committee member Mirza Abbas today questioned the glorification of former Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Ghulam Azam and his associates, saying such narratives insult the country's freedom fighters. \"If Ghulam Azam and his associates are regarded as the best sons of the nation, then the brave freedom fighters are being insulted,\" he said, asking where the freedom fighters' position then stands. Mirza Abbas made the remarks while responding to journalists after paying homage at the National Memorial in Savar on behalf of the BNP at around 8:45am. Referring to Jamaat-e-Islami, he said the party has never wished peace for the country since 1947. \"From 1947 to 1971, they did not want the country's independence, and they still do not want Bangladesh to be independent. They want the country to fall into crisis, to deteriorate, and to remain in turmoil,\" he said. Asked about attempts to pit 1971 against 2024, Mirza Abbas said the two periods are not comparable. \"1971 and 2024 stand on their own. There is no comparison between 1971 and 2024.\" he added.",

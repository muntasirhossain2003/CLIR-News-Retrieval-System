    "body": "The United Nations has strongly condemned a deadly drone attack on a UN peacekeeping base in Sudan's South Kordofan that killed six Bangladeshi peacekeepers and wounded eight others, calling the assault \"horrific\" and warning it may constitute a war crime. According to a UN report, the attack took place on Saturday when drones targeted the UN logistics base in Kadugli, killing six peacekeepers and injuring eight others. All the casualties were members of the Bangladeshi contingent serving with the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). UN Secretary-General António Guterres strongly condemned the attack, offering his \"deepest condolences\" to the government and people of Bangladesh as well as to the families of the fallen peacekeepers. He also wished a swift recovery to those injured. \"Attacks targeting United Nations peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law,\" Guterres said in a statement, reminding all parties to the conflict of their obligation to protect UN personnel and civilians. He described the assault in South Kordofan as \"unjustifiable\". The secretary-general expressed solidarity with thousands of peacekeepers serving in dangerous environments under the UN flag and renewed his call for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sudan, urging warring parties to resume talks toward a lasting ceasefire and an inclusive political process. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said in a social media post that he was \"shocked by today's horrific drone attack,\" stressing that \"UN peacekeepers are not a target\" and reiterating that the attack may amount to a war crime. Kadugli is the capital of South Kordofan, a region that has seen intense fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, who have been at war for nearly three years. The area lies near the oil-rich Abyei region, contested by Sudan and South Sudan since their separation in 2011. UNISFA was established in 2011 and currently includes nearly 4,000 military and police personnel, alongside civilian staff. Its mandate includes protecting civilians, supporting local policing, facilitating humanitarian aid, and monitoring the security situation in the region. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has expressed deep shock over the deaths of six Bangladeshi peacekeepers and injuries to eight others. In a statement, the chief adviser said he was deeply saddened by the deaths of the peacekeepers who were working to bring peace and stability to the region. He said Bangladesh's role in UN peacekeeping is well known around the world, and that the sacrifice of these soldiers is both a matter of pride and profound sorrow. He prayed for the souls of the deceased and expressed sympathy for their families. He also wished the injured peacekeepers a speedy recovery. Prof Yunus said, \"The government has already asked the United Nations to provide the best medical care and support for the injured. The government will stand beside the families during this difficult time.\" He strongly condemned the attack, calling it a serious crime against peace and humanity, and urged the UN and the international community to take stronger steps to protect peacekeepers. The statement also said Bangladesh is working closely with the UN to bring the bodies of the fallen soldiers home swiftly and to ensure proper treatment for the injured.",

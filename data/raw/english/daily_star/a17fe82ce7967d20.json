    "body": "Tarique Rahman will return to Bangladesh on December 25, BNP says. \"We are pleased to announce that the acting chairman of the party, Tarique Rahman, will return to Dhaka on December 25,\" said BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir. Fakhrul provided the information to reporters following a meeting of the party's permanent committee tonight. Also present at the meeting were standing committee members of the party, including Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Nazrul Islam Khan, Moin Khan, Mirza Abbas, Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, and other senior leaders. Tarique has been living in London since 2008. In 2009, he became BNP's senior vice chairman and gradually took on a key leadership role. In 2018, after his mother, former prime minister and BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, was jailed, Tarique was made acting chairman and has since led the party from abroad, virtually attending meetings and rallies. Tarique was arrested on March 7, 2007, during the 1/11 caretaker government. He was granted bail in September 2008 and left for the UK on September 11 for medical treatment. During the Awami League's tenure, he was convicted in absentia in five cases and faced around 100 lawsuits. Following the fall of the Awami League government on August 5 last year, all charges against him were dropped, and there are currently no pending cases.",

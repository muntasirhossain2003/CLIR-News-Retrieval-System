    "body": "Nepal yesterday launched a nationwide tiger census, a key step in conservation efforts to aid the recovery of the big cats that once faced near extinction in the Himalayan nation. The survey will be conducted in four national parks in Nepal's forested southern plains, covering more than 8,000 square kilometres of protected areas and adjoining forests, officials said. More than 2,300 motion-sensitive camera traps will be deployed, with over 250 conservation staff mobilised for the operation covering the Chitwan, Banke, Bardiya and Shuklaphanta national parks. Results are expected by July 2026. Haribhadra Acharya, coordinator of the National Tiger Census Technical Committee, said cameras helped scientists isolate individual animals with their unique stripe.",

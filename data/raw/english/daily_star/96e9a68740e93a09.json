    "title": "Prosecution appeals SC to upgrade life sentences of Hasina, Kamal to death",
    "body": "The prosecution has filed an appeal with the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court today, seeking to upgrade the life sentences of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to capital punishment. The appeal challenges part of the verdict delivered by the International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) on November 17 regarding crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising. While the tribunal had sentenced both leaders to death on one major charge, it handed down a sentence of \"imprisonment until natural death\" for a separate charge. Speaking to reporters today, ICT Prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hosain Tamim said, \"We have filed the appeal on eight grounds today to enhance the punishment on the charges where they were given life imprisonment.\"",

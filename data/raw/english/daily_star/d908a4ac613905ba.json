    "body": "Police early today arrested two individuals in connection with an attack on two members of the organisation, July Rebels, in Dhaka's Uttara area last evening. A team from Uttara East Police arrested Md Masum and Md Fahim Khan from the Dakshin Khan area, said Talebur Rahman, deputy commissioner (media) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police. \"Drives are ongoing to arrest other accused,\" he said. Two members of the organisation—Yasin, 19, and Rezwan, 22—were seriously injured after they were attacked with sharp weapons at the July Rebels office in Uttara. A member of the organisation, on condition of anonymity, said earlier that the victims were returning to their office after taking part in a human chain held outside the BNS Centre in Uttara protesting the shooting of Inqilab Moncho spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi. A group of 10 to 15 people suddenly entered the office and attacked the two members with sharp weapons, he said. The attackers were reportedly carrying firearms, but none were used during the assault, he added.",

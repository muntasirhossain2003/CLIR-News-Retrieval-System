Following the announcement of the schedule, several teams will visit different districts to conduct training programmes focused on election reporting. A three-day Training of Trainers (ToT) programme, organised to prepare trainers for the district-level sessions, concluded on Tuesday at PIB. Speaking at the certificate-giving ceremony, PIB Director General Faruk Wasif said journalists play a vital role in guiding the nation with accurate information in an era of disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation. He emphasised that local journalists will have a crucial role in ensuring credible coverage of the upcoming election. Addressing the programme as the chief guest, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Noor Md Mahbubul Haq said accurate and impartial election reporting is not just a responsibility but a service to the nation. It was announced that the nationwide training is being conducted under the \"Ballot\" project, with support from development partners including Australia, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and the UK.

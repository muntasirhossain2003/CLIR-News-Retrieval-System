    "body": "Rab-11 has arrested Sabina Yasmin Bithi, daughter of Subrata Bain alias Mohammad Fateh Ali, in front of Cumilla Central Jail on Monday afternoon. Company Commander Sadman Ibne Alam of Rab-11 CPC-2 confirmed the arrest, saying Bithi was held based on tip-off. After primary interrogation, she was handed over to the Detective Branch (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police on Monday night. Rab sources said Subrata Bain, 61, was transferred from Narayanganj District Jail to Cumilla Central Jail on December 5 for security and administrative reasons. Law enforcement officials said they are investigating whether Bithi was involved in financial transactions, communication networks, or assisting fugitive associates linked to her father's crime syndicate. Subrata, one of Bangladesh's most notorious criminals, has been named in recent killings in Dhaka. Police reports state that on April 21, 2025, his followers killed Ward Jubo Dal member Arif Sardar in Hatirjheel. Investigators also allege that his group smuggled arms from India to carry out murders and other crimes. Officials believe the transfer of Subrata to Cumilla jail and the arrest of his daughter could help expose the remnants of his criminal network.",

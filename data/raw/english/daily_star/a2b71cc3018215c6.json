    "title": "After 3yrs in Indian jail, 5 Bangladeshis return through Benapole",
    "body": "Five Bangladeshi nationals, including a couple, returned home through the Benapole check-post last night after serving three years in an Indian prison. They were formally handed over to Benapole Immigration Police by Indian immigration authorities under a travel permit issued by the governments of the two countries. The returnees are: Ruhul Mallik, of Ranagati village in Abhaynagar upazila of Jashore; Masum Molla, of Mulakandi village in Naria upazila in Shariatpur; Roni, of Purba Sonai village in Fatikchhari, Chattogram; Roni's wife Nazma Bibi; and Shankar Kumar, of Golna village under Dumuria upazila in Khulna. According to immigration officials, the returnees had entered India illegally at different times after being lured by human traffickers with promises of better employment. They were later arrested by Dum Dum police and jailed. Upon completion of their sentences, both the Indian and Bangladeshi ministries of foreign and home affairs approved their repatriation through travel permits. Benapole Immigration Police Officer-in-Charge SM Shakhawat Hossain said the returnees were handed over to Benapole Port Police after completion of formal procedures. From there, Justice and Care, an NGO, received them for safe reintegration. Md Shafiqul Islam, field facilitator of the organisation in Jashore, said the returnees will be handed over to their families today.",

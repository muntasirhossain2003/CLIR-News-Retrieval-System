    "body": "BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir urged the government to maintain law and order over the next two months and said the safe return of the party's acting chairman, Tarique Rahman, must be ensured with adequate security. \"Our acting Chairman, Tarique Rahman, is returning to Bangladesh on 25th December. This will be a special day for BNP, Begum Khaleda Zia, her family, and the nation,\" Fakhrul said in a Facebook post this morning. He stressed that the government's primary responsibility is to protect the life and property of every citizen, and election candidates. \"If necessary, a special interim security cell should be established,\" he added. Fakhrul also condemned the shooting of Sharif Osman Hadi, an independent MP aspirant for Dhaka-8 and spokesperson for Inqilab Moncho, calling the incident \"absolutely unacceptable.\" He pointed out that the shooting, which occurred a day after the announcement of the national election schedule, has triggered widespread public unrest. \"We expect the government to swiftly arrest the perpetrators and ensure that Hadi receives proper medical treatment without any delay,\" Fakhrul said. Yesterday, Fakhrul confirmed that Tarique is scheduled to return to Bangladesh on December 25.",

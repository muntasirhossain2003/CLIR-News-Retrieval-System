    "body": "A Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) activist was stabbed to death during a clash between two BNP groups in Mirsarai upazila of Chattogram on Wednesday evening over what police described as a trivial issue. The victim, Mohammad Tahmid Ullah, 19, of East Hinguli union under Baroiarhat municipality, was a Class 9 madrasa student, police said. Jorarganj Police Station OC Kazi Nazmul Haque said the clash began when an activist placed his foot on a chair during a local arbitration meeting. Tahmid was taken to Chattogram Medical College Hospital, where he died around 1:00am yesterday, he said, adding that police are investigating. However, Didarul Alam Miazi, former president of BNP Baroiarhat municipality unit, claimed the incident was not political but a personal dispute. He said Tahmid had recently joined JCD. Miazi said a Swechasebak Dal leader, Abdullah Al Jubaer, had placed his feet on a chair at Baroiarhat Bazar, prompting a rebuke from Nazrul Islam Liton. The altercation later escalated into a clash between the two groups, during which Tahmid was stabbed.",

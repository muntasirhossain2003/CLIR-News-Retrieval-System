The former prime minister has been placed on elective ventilator support to rest her lungs and other organs, her doctors said on Thursday. The BNP Media Cell said last night that her condition remains unchanged. She has developed several additional complications, including infective endocarditis, acute pancreatitis, and severe bacterial and fungal infections. Khaleda, 80, was admitted to the hospital on November 23 on the advice of her medical board after being diagnosed with infections in her heart and lungs. She has long been battling multiple complications, including liver cirrhosis, arthritis, diabetes, and chronic issues affecting her kidneys, lungs, heart, and eyes. Dr Zubaida Rahman, wife of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, arrived in Dhaka on December 5 and has been overseeing her treatment since then.",

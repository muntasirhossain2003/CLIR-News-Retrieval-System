    "body": "The proliferation of thousands of red water lilies across Sananda Beel has turned a quiet wetland in Moulvibazar into a rapidly emerging tourism hotspot, reshaping the local economy. Situated in the Mirzapur union of Sreemangal within the vast Hail Haor region, the water body—widely known as 'Lal Shapla Beel'—has become a focal point for visitors nationwide. The sheer density of the blooms creates the visual effect of a crimson carpet stretching across the water, flanked by green lily pads. Hail Haor, a massive wetland shared by Sreemangal and Sadar upazilas of Moulvibazar and the Bahubal upazila of Habiganj, contains 14 distinct beels (lakes). Sananda Beel has recently distinguished itself solely due to the abundance of the red Shapla (water lilies). The influx of tourists has generated immediate economic dividends for residents. The area, once reliant primarily on agriculture and fishing, is seeing a surge in small-scale enterprise, with local hotels, restaurants, and markets reporting increased trade. Fishermen are also pivoting to accommodate the demand. Tahir Mia, a local boatman, noted the shift in livelihood. \"Instead of fishing, we are now making a living by offering boat rides for visitors to explore the beel,\" said Tahir, who now doubles as a tour guide. Tourists describe the site as a spectacle, though timing is crucial. Mirzapur High School senior teacher Mohammad Abu Azam advised that the flora is best viewed at dawn, as the flowers bloom nocturnally and remain open in the early morning light. \"I have never seen so many red Shapla flowers in one place. It is like a dream,\" said Dipan Dasgupta, a student visiting from Rajshahi. Fahim Ahmed, a visitor from Dhaka, added, \"This season is truly special. The beel has turned into a kingdom of red Shapla.\" The rapid commercialisation of the wetland has prompted concerns regarding environmental degradation. Beyond the flora, the beel is a sanctuary for migratory birds, adding to its ecological value. Residents and traders have issued pleas for responsible tourism. \"It has brought a wave of positive changes to the local economy, but we also urge people not to pick the flowers, just enjoy their beauty,\" said local trader Md Zakir Hossain. Sreemangal Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Islam Uddin, confirmed that the administration is aware of the rising popularity of the site. \"Both Sreemangal and Mirzapur are becoming well-known in the tourism circuit. We are prioritising measures to ensure the convenience and safety of visitors,\" he said.",

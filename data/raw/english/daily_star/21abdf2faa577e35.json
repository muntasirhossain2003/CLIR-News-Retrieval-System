    "title": "Journalist Shaukat Mahmood placed on 5-day remand in anti-terrorism case",
    "body": "A Dhaka court today placed senior journalist and Janata Party Bangladesh Secretary General Shaukat Mahmood on a five-day remand in an anti-terrorism case. Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Fahmida Khondaker Anna passed the order after the Detective Branch of police produced him before the court with a 10-day remand prayer, said a court staffer. Shaukat, a former president of Jatiya Press Club, was arrested from his home on December 7 as a suspect, though he is not an FIR-named accused in the case. On September 14, Sub-Inspector Azizul Hakim of Ramna Model Police Station filed the anti-terrorism case against 55-year-old Enayet Karim Chowdhury, a US citizen of Bangladeshi origin, a day after his arrest in Dhaka for suspicious movement and alleged conspiracy to overthrow the interim government. Enayet was arrested on September 13 on Dhaka's Minto Road. He was later produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court of Dhaka and sent to jail. According to the case statement, during primary interrogation, Enayet confessed that he came to Bangladesh as an agent of a foreign intelligence agency, with the objective of overthrowing the present interim government. This claim was initially supported by data found in the seized mobile phones from his possession.",

    "body": "BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's condition remains unchanged and is under the supervision of her medical board at the capital's Evercare Hospital. Her medical board held a routine review meeting and found that no fresh deterioration was noticed as of yesterday evening. Doctors advised that until the former prime minister's condition stabilises enough for her to fly for advanced treatment, she will undergo treatment at the healthcare facility. Around 7:00pm, BNP media cell, quoting Khaleda's personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain, said her condition remains the same. Zubaida Rahman, wife of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman and Khaleda's daughter-in-law, spoke to doctors at Evercare and met her yesterday. Zubaida, who is also a medical board member, attends its meetings. Health Adviser Noorjahan Begum visited the hospital last night to enquire about the BNP chief's condition. On the advice of doctors, Khaleda was admitted to the hospital on November 23 after being diagnosed with infections affecting her heart and lungs. She is also suffering from pneumonia and is currently receiving treatment in the hospital's Coronary Care Unit. Khaleda, 80, has long been battling multiple health complications, including liver cirrhosis. Meanwhile, events praying for her speedy recovery were held in different parts of the country, including Dhaka, Tangail, Rajshahi, Brahmanbaria, Rangpur, Chattogram, and Naogaon. Party leaders and activists continued to gather outside the hospital yesterday, despite repeated instructions from the party not to crowd the premises.",

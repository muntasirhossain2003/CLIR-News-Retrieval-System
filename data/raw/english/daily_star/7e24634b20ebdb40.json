Mirza Abbas said, \"According to today's reports in the newspapers, her [Khaleda Zia's] condition is stable, meaning it hasn't worsened. We pray to Almighty Allah that her condition remains stable and improves further.\" \"We truly need her. At this critical time, for the nation, Begum Khaleda Zia is vital to all political parties.\" At the event, Mirza Abbas said, \"Recently, I spoke with a group of young members from another political group. I asked them if they would join us for the election.\" \"They said they would, but only under certain conditions. They've stated they'll join if their reform demands are met.\" \"I don't understand what they mean by reforms. I wanted to ask them what kind of reforms they are referring to. I wanted to know exactly what reforms they are talking about, but they couldn't explain.\"",

    "body": "Dhaka’s air quality showed a slight improvement on Wednesday morning as it ranked the 26th worst in the Air Quality Index (AQI). The air in Dhaka was categorised as ‘moderate’ as the megacity had an AQI score of 54 at 09:22am. When the AQI remains in between 51 and 100, there may be a risk for some people who may be unusually sensitive to particle pollution. However, the air quality is acceptable. Indonesia’s Jakarta, Pakistan’s Lahore and India’s Delhi occupied the first three spots in the list of cities with AQI scores of 170, 167 and 153 respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants – Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). Dhaka’s air remains mostly acceptable during the monsoon season from June to October. To stay on top of the ever-changing world of business, subscribe now to our newsletters.

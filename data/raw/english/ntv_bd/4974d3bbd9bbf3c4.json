    "body": "Every time the World Cup comes around, whether it is the football or cricket championship, a lot of households with sports-fanatic members welcome new TVs to their living rooms and bedrooms. Hype for the big-screen ones, enriched with high resolution and other updated features, has been developing in the contemporary market for quite some time now. To enjoy the upcoming FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 to the fullest, now there is a rising demand for big TVs in the market. However, not everyone is convinced enough to shell out the big amount to get a bigger television. Is a bigger TV really worth the high cost? Here are a few considerations – First of all, whether we’re watching sports, playing games, or watching a movie, we now expect our entertainment to be immersive. We want to feel like we are there in the crowd. Hence, a big TV screen depending on the size of your living room can actually make you feel as if you are among the crowd cheering on the players in a football match or any other sports. However, the bigger the TV, the more essential the issue of resolution becomes. Today, in the market, big TVs are available with three resolution options – 1080p, 4K, and 8K. So, an ultra-high-resolution TV like Samsung’s QLED 8K packs a whopping 33 million pixels into its screen. Such high resolution makes the pixels invisible on a big-screen TV – expanding your immersion by creating a high-quality, crisp picture quality on your big TV screen. Besides, many of us like to watch TV with family and friends huddling around the TV screen. For those groups a TV with bigger screens are perfect– everyone will get to see more of the game or the movie and the atmosphere will be electric. In the market many TV manufacturers are using 4K UHD technology, hence the picture quality doesn’t get compromised by the screen’s size or the distance you sit from it. A large screen also means that you can fit an actual crowd in your living room and everyone can still see the screen giving you a genuinely immersive experience. Previously, a big TV meant that it would take up a lot of space in the room. But modern smart LED TVs often take up less space than older chunkier models. Now, the bezel – the plastic or metal frame around the screen is almost invisible in most new TVs. And they’re slimmer and lighter, making them easier to wall mount and take up almost no space in your living room. Interestingly, some brands like Samsung recently have introduced such innovation in their TV design that the TV frame on your wall will almost look like hanging artwork. Thus, bigger TV is better, in most respects — it's more immersive and easier to see and can be easily fit into in your living room, not to mention more impressive when showing off to the neighbors. With this in mind, it’s clear to see why people are consistently rating screen size as one of the most important factors that affect their TV purchasing decisions. After realizing this huge demand for bigger TVs in Bangladesh, Samsung Consumers Electronics has recently launched an exclusive new campaign titled “Bigger size, Bigger offers”. Many people are taking advantage of this chance and bringing the global number 1 big crystal 4K UHD televisions home. The discount offers can be availed at official Samsung Consumer Electronic outlets. Hence, without any ado, hurry up and visit your nearest official Samsung store or order online to bring home a big TV this year!

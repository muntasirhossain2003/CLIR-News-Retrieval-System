Directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, the film also stars Tabu, Sunil Grover and Disha Patani in pivotal roles. Salman Khan took to his social media profile to share the teaser of the first song titled 'Slow Motion'. The makers recently dropped the first song of the much-awaited movie and we are sure it is something you shouldn't miss, reports the indiatimes.com. The first song from the film features Salman Khan and Disha Patani. The song is from the 1960's era and we can see superstar Salman shaking a leg with his Jawaani Janeman, Disha. Disha's yellow saree will make you nostalgic about the 90's era of Raveena Tandon and her iconic look from her popular song 'Tip Tip Barsa Pani'. While on the other hand, Salman can be seen in an all-white outfit and his young version shaking legs with his ladylove is all enough to woo the audience across quarters. This peppy dance number is sung by Vishal, Shekhar featuring Nakash Aziz and Shreya Ghoshal. Lyrics are penned by Irshad Kamil. The song has 60’s vibe and their funky dance moves are too hot to miss! In this film, Salman will be sporting five different looks through the years of his life. 'Bharat' is an official adaptation of the 2014 South Korean movie 'Ode To My Father' and it is slated to release on Eid 2019.

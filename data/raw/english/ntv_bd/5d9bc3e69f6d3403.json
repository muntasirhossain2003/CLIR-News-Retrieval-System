    "body": "A powerful performance by Rajshahi Royals in all departments helped them crush Khulna Tigers by 21 runs in the final to win the Bangabandhu Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) on Friday. Earlier, Royals posted 170 for 4 in 20 overs against Tigers in the final at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Tigers won the toss and sent Royals to bat first. Despite a good start, Royals lost Afif Hossain (10) in the third over. He fell prey to a short ball by Mohammad Amir. Afif skied the ball and Mehidy Hasan Miraz sprinted from his position to take a wonderful catch at short third-man area. In the second wicket stand, Liton Das and Irfan Shukkur posted 49 runs. But Liton fell for 25 off 28 with one four and one six. However, Irfan proved his mettle scoring 52 of 35 with six fours and two sixes. Along the process of hitting a fifty, Irfan became the only uncapped Bangladeshi to hit a fifty in BPL final. Pakistan all-rounder Shoaib Malik came to bat at number four and scored nine only.

At the red carpet of Zee Cine Awards 2019, the stunner donned a red bold dress with hair and make-up on fleek. She definitely made heads turn on the red carpet with her bold and stunning attire, reports the pinkvilla.com. After her divorce with husband Arbaaz Khan last year, the diva is dating her rumoured boyfriend Arjun Kapoor. The two are spotted hanging around together in the city and posing to the shutterbugs.

Pariseau says no date has been set for the nuptials. Johansson, 34, was previously married to actor Ryan Reynolds and journalist Romain Dauriac, with whom she has a daughter named Rose who was born in 2014. This is the first marriage for the 36-year-old Jost, who is the co-anchor of SNL’s Weekend Update. The couple recently walked the red carpet together at the premiere of ‘Avengers: Endgame,’ in which Johansson plays the character of Black Widow.

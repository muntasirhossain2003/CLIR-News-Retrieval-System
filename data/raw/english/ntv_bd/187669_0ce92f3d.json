    "body": "Two days after a deadly train crash in Brahmanbaria, four compartments of another train, Rangpur Express, caught fire in Ullapara on Thursday noon, snapping rail links between Dhaka and northern districts. Nazir Hossain, station officer of Ullapara Fire Service and Civil Defence, said five bogies, including the locomotive, of the train derailed near Ullapara railway station around 1:30pm. Later, four of them caught fire immediately, he said, adding that the reason behind the fire could not be known. Hossain, however, could not exactly say about any casualty in the incident. On Tuesday, at least 16 passengers were killed and over 100 others injured in a collision of two trains at Mandbagh in Brahmanbaria. The deadly collision between Dhaka-bound Turnanishita from Chattogram and Chattogram-bound Udayan Express from Sylhet took place around 3 am.

Iqbal Hossain, a Bangladeshi-American, is developing a tax return software intending to make tax-filing accessible and accurate, and the software is going to be launched soon. He is also developing a tax preparer course that will help anyone who intends to develop a career in the tax industry. Asked about the details of tax return software, Mr. Iqbal said, \"With this software, anyone can easily do all the activities of tax filing completely free from their home. Any CPA (Certified Public Accountant) firm, tax preparer, and accountant in the United States can file their tax return with an annual subscription. We have already completed the framework of this software. We hope to bring it to the global market soon.\" Noor Tax and Immigration company, established in 1999 in Hamtramck City, Michigan, US, is also conducting a complete tax preparer course on how to file tax returns. \"Tax return software and tax preparer course are our new additions.

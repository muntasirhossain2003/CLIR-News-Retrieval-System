    "body": "Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka ranked second among cities with the worst quality in the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Wednesday morning. It had an AQI score of 205 at 8:44am.The air was classified as ‘very unhealthy’, the UNB reported. Thailand’s Chiang Mai and Vietnam’s Hanoi occupied the first and third positions with AQI scores of 208 and 163 respectively. When the AQI value is between 201 and 300, the entire population is more likely to be affected. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants – Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution. The air quality usually improves during monsoon. To stay on top of the ever-changing world of business, subscribe now to our newsletters.

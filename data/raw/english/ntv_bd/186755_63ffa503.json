Habibe Millat, who heads the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU) Advisory Group on Health, recently addressed the Pan-African Parliament (PAP), also known as the African Parliament. He spoke on the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) at the second general session of the fifth PAP on Tuesday (14 May). Some 33 countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Morocco, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Lesotho and Gambia discussed on his speech and highlighted the need for spending more in the healthcare of their respective countries. Millat has been tasked by the IPU with preparing the first draft of a resolution on the UHC. He proposed the resolution, which is expected to be adopted in October in the 141st inter-parliamentary union in Serbia. In his speech, Millat also highlighted the role of parliamentarians as a public representative in ensuing universal health coverage and quality healthcare. The PAP is the legislative body of the 53 African nations and held its inaugural session in March 2004. It is a continental house of representatives with consultative and advisory powers. It works, among other things, to facilitate the effective implementation of AU policies and to promote human rights, democracy peace, security and stability in Africa.

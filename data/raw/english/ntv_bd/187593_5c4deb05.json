    "body": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) has banned Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan from all forms of cricket for two years, with keeping it suspended for one year, as he failed to report a corrupt approach. In a press release on Tuesday evening, the world cricket body stated that Shakib was found to be guilty of breaching three counts of charge of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code. The three codes that Shakib has breached are Article 2.4.4 – Failure to disclose to the ACU full details of any approaches or invitations he received to engage in Corrupt Conduct - in relation to the Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe Tri-Series in January 2018 and/or the 2018 IPL; Article 2.4.4 – Failure to disclose to the ACU full details of any approaches or invitations he received to engage in Corrupt Conduct - in relation to a second approach in respect of the Tri-Series in January 2018; and Article 2.4.4 – Failure to disclose to the ACU full details of any approaches or invitations he received to engage in Corrupt Conduct - in relation to an IPL 2018 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad v Kings XI Punjab on 26 April 2018. Shakib got his first international cap back in 2006 with an ODI against Zimbabwe in Harare. Since then, he has been an integral part of Bangladesh cricket team. However, he was never free from controversy. He earlier had suffered a six-month ban as well which was imposed by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). The all-rounder represented Bangladesh in 56 Tests, 206 ODIs and 76 T20Is till the date. He amassed 11,752 runs in international cricket and scalped 562 wickets. He is one of the few all-rounders who have the double of more than 10,000 runs and more than 500 wickets in international cricket.

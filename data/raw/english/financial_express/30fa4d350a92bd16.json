    "body": "Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday said national leader, three-time former Prime Minister, one of the leading figures of democratic politics and BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia is an integral part of an important chapter in Bangladesh history. \"As you know, the national leader, three-time former Prime Minister of the country, one of the leading figures of democratic politics and BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia is currently in the hospital in a critical condition. This is a matter of concern for all of us,\" he said. While addressing the nation on Tuesday evening, Prof Yunus said the interim government has been giving utmost importance to Begum Khaleda Zia's health issues since the beginning. \"Considering her unwavering commitment to the independence, sovereignty and democracy of Bangladesh, her contribution to the development of the country and the people's respectful feelings towards her, the government has already declared her as a VVIP,\" he said. The government is providing all necessary assistance to ensure her treatment, respecting the wishes of the family. In addition to her treatment in the country, all matters, including advanced medical treatment abroad, if necessary, are being considered, Prof Yunus said. After assuming office, he said, the interim government has given utmost importance to three issues - the trial of the July-August massacre, the necessary fundamental reforms of the state structure for the transition to an accountable and effective democratic system, and a fair election. The trial of the massacres committed by the then fascist government during the July Uprising is proceeding in due legal process. The verdict of one case has already been announced by the tribunal. The International Crimes Tribunal has sentenced former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the head of the fallen fascist government, to death for being the main instigator of the indiscriminate killings of students, workers and the general public of the country, through an independent and transparent evidence-based trial process. As part of the due legal process, he said the government has formally requested the Indian government to return Hasina, who has been absconding since the uprising, and former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, another accused convicted in this case, to the country. Prof Yunus said a number of institutional and structural reforms have already been completed. Dozens of old laws have been amended, and several new laws have been enacted,he sThe biggest step in the reforms is the July National Charter. It has been issued in the form of an order to ensure fundamental constitutional reforms. \"Dear people of the country, I have come before you today with a very heavy heart. On this joyous day, I inform you with deep sorrow that the recent attack on Sharif Osman Hadi, the spokesperson of the Inqilab Mancha, a frontline fighter of the July Uprising, is not just an attack on an individual-it is an attack on the existence of Bangladesh, an attack on our democratic path,\" he said. Sharif Osman Hadi is currently undergoing treatment in a critical condition. The government has taken all necessary measures to ensure his treatment and safety, Prof Yunus said. He has already been sent to Singapore for better treatment. \"Please pray to Almighty Allah for him from the bottom of your hearts.\" \"The government is taking this incident very seriously. Those involved in the incident have been initially identified,\" the Chief Adviser said. \"I want to assure the countrymen that no one involved in this conspiracy, no matter where they are, will be spared,\" he mentioned. The Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) has detained the father of Faisal Karim Masud, the key suspect in the attack on Inqilab Moncho leader Sharif Osman bin Hadi, as the investigation into the attempted killing intensifies. After the detention, the RAB said it had recovered two firearms from Narsingdi and brought Faisal’s mother to its office for questioning. The information was confirmed around Tuesday midnight by Wing Commander MZM Intekhhab Chowdhury, director of RAB’s law and media wing. He said an object resembling a pistol was also recovered. “Of these, one pistol is suspected to have been used in the attack on Hadi.” RAB’s spokesperson said further details would be shared later. Earlier in the case, RAB arrested Faisal’s wife, his girlfriend, his brother-in-law, a man suspected of owning the motorcycle used in the attack, an associate known only as Kabir, and two individuals detained at the border on allegations of assisting Faisal to flee. An attempted murder case was filed with Paltan Police on Sunday night with the consent of Hadi’s family. Inqilab Moncho Member Secretary Abdullah Al Jaber lodged the case. Hadi rose to prominence during the July Uprising and the movement to ban the Awami League, and had announced his intention to contest in the parliamentary elections as an independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency. He was attacked on Friday while carrying out public outreach at Bijoynagar. Assailants riding a moving motorcycle shot him while he was travelling in a rickshaw, with the bullet striking his head. Gravely wounded, Hadi was rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for surgery and later admitted to Evercare Hospital the same night. Doctors described his condition as “extremely critical”. On Monday afternoon, he was flown to Singapore by air ambulance for further treatment.

Since the Liberation War, \"Birangona\" or war heroine Sheikh Fatema Ali has found no respite from humiliation. The wartime rape victim has been continuously neglected and subjected to slander and social stigma. The war crimes survivor has never found peace, nor even a chance to heal the wounds inflicted on her by the occupying Pakistan Army. Instead, she has endured humiliation and ostracisation, and watched her daughter’s family fall apart. Now, nearing the end of her life, Fatema’s one wish is that her descendants do not have to carry the burden of her suffering. The victim of sexual violence in the 1971 war broke down at the launch of the first volume of a planned three-volume anthology on the history of the Liberation War. The first volume of the compilation, titled “Raktorekhay Bangladesh – Antoheen Juddho: Gourob, Bedona Ar Shikorer Itihash” — “Bangladesh, Penned in Blood: An Endless War, a storied legacy of grief and glory” — was released on Victory Day on Tuesday. Fatema was visibly overwhelmed at the event. In brief but emotional remarks, she said: “Today, bdnews24.com has honoured someone as unfortunate as me, and I feel proud. I thank them for it. It has been 54 years since independence. If only the respect bdnews24.com has shown us was reflected everywhere. Being treated with dignity like this brings me to tears.” Her voice breaking, she added: “Please don’t look down on us any longer. Help us live as human beings. Make sure we are never humiliated again. I wanted peace for this country, though I don’t know if God will grant it.” At least 15 people have been injured in a scuffle between the activists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami during a Victory Day event in Bhola’s Daulatkhan. Daulatkhan Police chief Saiful Islam Shikder said the incident occurred at the Ghaznavi Stadium on Tuesday. The Upazila administration organised the event, attended by freedom fighters, families of martyrs, and members of political parties, including the BNP and Jamaat. Jamaat’s Daulatkhan Upazila unit’s Secretary Ashraf Uddin Faruque said they were attacked by the BNP activists without any provocation. The administration and police acted as mere bystanders during the attack, Jamaat alleged. Between 15 and 20 Jamaat activists have been injured during the attack, he said. Local BNP leaders could not be reached for comments. Daulatkhan Upazila Jubo Dal Joint Convenor Jahirul Islam said they found Jamaat activists raising a ruckus at the venue after occupying chairs. A scuffle broke out following a comment from a civil society member that freedom fighters were standing while the anti-liberation force was sitting in chairs, he said. I am a supporter of independence, but Jamaat activists attending the event seemed unpleasant to me, he said, adding that he, however, had no role in the humiliation of Jamaat activists.",

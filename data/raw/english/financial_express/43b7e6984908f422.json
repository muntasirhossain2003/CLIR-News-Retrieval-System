    "title": "Farmers busy preparing Boro seedbeds in Sylhet",
    "body": "Farmers across four districts in Sylhet division are racing against time to prepare seedbeds as the window for Boro rice cultivation rapidly closes. With the target for Boro farming this season set at 497,683 hectares, officials and farmers are working hard to meet the deadline. The target for Boro cultivation is divided between haor and non-haor areas, with 266,848 hectares designated for haor regions and 220,805 hectares for non-haor regions. The breakdown by district is as follows: in Sylhet 87,800 hectares, in Moulvibazar 62,500 hectares, in Habiganj 123,848 hectares, and in Sunamganj 223,505 hectares (the highest in the division). According to an official from the Sylhet divisional office of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), the target for seedbed preparation this year is 23,437 hectares. To date, 18,120 hectares of seedbeds have been prepared. In comparison, 25,975 hectares were prepared last year. While progress in haor areas is nearly complete, with 98 per cent of the target achieved, seedbed preparation in non-haor areas has been slower, with only about 20 per cent of the target area covered. Officials anticipate that more work will be done in non-haor areas as there is still time before the planting season begins. Dilwar Hossain, a farmer from Kandigaon village in Golapganj upazila, mentioned that while land preparation is still ongoing, it will be completed within two weeks. l. Farmers in the haor region, where Boro rice farming is a primary livelihood, face the added challenge of protecting their crops from early rains and storms. The government has placed special emphasis on safeguarding these crops, as such weather events can cause significant damage. To mitigate this risk, many farmers are opting for short-duration Boro rice varieties that can be harvested early, reducing the likelihood of storm damage. The expansion work of Cox's Bazar Airport has created serious environmental and navigational hazards, as the support infrastructure for the extended runway is being constructed by piling at the mouth of the Maheshkhali Channel, where the Bakkhali River meets the sea. Experts warn that the development has already begun to disrupt natural water flow, posing a major threat to the Cox's Bazar-St. Martin's Island shipping route and the livelihood of Sonadia Island residents. According to the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), structures now occupy nearly 59 per cent of the river's width, causing rapid siltation along approximately 2.5 kilometres of the channel. If the situation continues, the Maheshkhali Channel may lose its navigability, potentially forcing the closure of one of the country's most important southern sea routes. As part of the airport expansion, runway facilities and aircraft approach lighting systems have been installed at the river-sea confluence of the Maheshkhali Channel. The construction of temporary jetties and other structures on the river foreshore has obstructed the natural current, accelerating sediment deposition and the formation of sandbars. As a result, the channel's mouth is gradually narrowing. BIWTA reports that the impact of the runway expansion has already caused severe navigational difficulties in the Nazirartek area. Although an alternative channel has formed along the western side of Sonadia Island, it is gradually shifting further west, raising concerns about long-term environmental damage and risks to local settlements on the island. In this context, BIWTA has recommended the removal of the runway's auxiliary structures built on piles within the Maheshkhali Channel. In a letter signed by BIWTA Chairman Commodore Arif Ahmed Mostafa and sent to the Ministry of Shipping, the authorities highlighted the urgent need to address the issue. The letter stressed that a comprehensive study-covering hydrology, sediment transport, environmental, social, and economic impacts-must be conducted by a consultant firm, funded by the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB), to assess the long-term consequences on the Maheshkhali Channel and surrounding waterways. The study should include a full Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). BIWTA has also alleged that CAAB implemented the project without obtaining mandatory clearance from the authorities responsible for river ports and navigable channels. The letter further noted that more than Tk 41.2 million in unpaid revenue is due to BIWTA for the use of foreshore land, construction of temporary jetties, and loading and unloading of materials. BIWTA has recommended convening an urgent inter-ministerial meeting to resolve the matter. Sources said that expanding the airport inland would have required the demolition of numerous hotels, motels, and private establishments, along with costly and time-consuming land acquisition. To avoid these challenges, CAAB opted to extend the runway towards the river and the sea, allegedly without consulting BIWTA. The project, launched in 2021, aims to extend the runway to 10,700 feet, with approximately 1,300 feet constructed over river and sea areas. Initially estimated at Tk 15.69 billion, the project cost has risen to nearly Tk 17.94 billion. Two Chinese construction companies are jointly implementing the project. BIWTA has warned that unless immediate and effective measures are taken, the Maheshkhali Channel could suffer irreversible damage. Such an outcome would severely affect key southern shipping routes, including the Cox's Bazar-St. Martin's route, as well as tourism and the local economy. Rajshahi University (RU) on Thursday officially launched the Veterinary Teaching Hospital and Research Center to provide free treatment for both pets and farm animals. The centre, under the Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, is located just behind the university's Agriculture Faculty building. The hospital aims to deliver hands-on training for students while offering essential veterinary services-from medical consultations to necessary medicines - at no cost. The hospital offers general health checkups for pets such as dogs and cats, as well as diagnosis and treatment for livestock including cattle, goats, ducks, and poultry. Free veterinary consultations and medicines are available every Sunday to Thursday from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Local farmer Shawkat Hossain described the initiative as a timely and significant step for the region. He said the centre would reduce financial pressure on farmers and help lower the mortality rate of animals caused by lack of proper care. Residents living around the campus also expressed satisfaction, noting that pet healthcare has become more accessible than ever. Hospital authorities said students, farmers, and general citizens are welcome to receive services. They urged people to bring their pets or livestock to the hospital as soon as any health issue is detected. Prantor Karmakar, a student of the Veterinary and Animal Sciences Department and an intern doctor at the hospital, noted that the centre has not only expanded research opportunities for students but has also become a trusted support hub for farmers across the region. \"With free diagnosis, treatment advice, and medicines, the financial burden of marginal farmers has greatly reduced. The hospital is playing a vital role in lowering animal mortality by ensuring timely treatment,\" he added. Dr Md Hemayatul Islam, director of the hospital, said this is the first time RU has launched a full veterinary care facility for both pets and livestock. \"We are providing all services free of charge. From cats and dogs to cows, goats and sheep-every type of animal is being treated here. The centre began formal operations last month, and we plan to expand our services further by recruiting more doctors and staff,\" he said. An attempt was made to set the office of the Upazila election officer on fire in Pirojpur’s Mathbaria on Saturday morning. Mathbaria Police chief Sheikh Helal Uddin confirmed media about the attempt. Some unidentified individuals tried to pour petrol into the office by breaking a window on its first floor around 4:00 am, witnesses said. A stick wrapped with a fabric soaked in petrol was used to set the office on fire, witnesses said. Basudeb Sarkar, the Upazila election officer, said there was no damage done to the office by the fire.",

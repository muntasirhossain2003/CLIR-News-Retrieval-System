    "title": "Is Bangladesh trending toward Gerontocracy?",
    "body": "Bangladesh is a young country trapped in old politics. The median age is just over 27, yet the people making national decisions are often three times older. The caretaker government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus brings global respect, but its makeup tells a different story: aside from a couple of student advisers, the cabinet is dominated by senior figures whose average age reflects the continuity of an older generation at a time when the country's future is increasingly shaped by the young. It is one of the most age-heavy governing teams in the country's history-and among the oldest in the world. This mismatch is not a quirk of political timing. It reflects a deeper structural problem: Bangladesh's leadership is aging rapidly, even as the country's citizens are growing younger, more digitally connected, and more globally aware. For a country racing to secure middle-income status and navigate a turbulent world, this generational gap is becoming a strategic liability. The result is a widening gap between who Bangladesh is and who governs it-a divergence that raises a troubling question: is Bangladesh drifting toward gerontocracy? South Asia reveres age. Seniority is often equated with wisdom, patience, and good judgment. But cultural respect does not give older leaders a lifetime lease on national leadership. Healthy political systems celebrate senior figures while opening genuine pathways for the next generation. Bangladesh struggles on that front. The mixed record of the caretaker government's student advisers-thrust into national crisis without preparation or mentoring-says more about the nature of ad hoc appointments than about youth capacity. Their experience should not be misread as a verdict on an entire generation. And the problem extends far beyond the interim government. The major political parties-BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami-are recycling familiar faces. Their lists of parliamentary hopefuls lean heavily toward long-standing senior figures. BNP's standing committee remains dominated by leaders in their '70s and '80s, and Jamaat's leadership is anchored in its '60s and '70s. Little suggests willingness to hand the reins to a new cohort. The bureaucracy tells a similar story. For decades, mandatory retirement helped maintain generational balance. That balance has been shaken willy-nilly. The interim regime has reinstated a large group of long-retired civil servants - often without much transparency or clear criteria - replacing officials deemed too close to the previous government. These returns-some years after formal retirement-disrupt natural succession, clog opportunities for younger officers, and weaken the meritocratic spine a modern civil service needs. Put together, these trends point to an unmistakable direction: Bangladesh is drifting toward gerontocracy. Power is consolidating among leaders whose long tenures risk detaching them from the aspirations, anxieties, and global outlook of the country's young majority. The scale of this generational mismatch is evident from international comparisons. ASIA: Japan, one of the world's oldest societies, has an average parliamentary age of about 55. South Korea's National Assembly averages around 53. India's Lok Sabha is younger still. Emerging democracies like Indonesia and Malaysia have median parliamentary ages in the late 40s. None of these countries-despite their older populations-has a political class as senior-heavy as Bangladesh's. EUROPE: The median age of European Parliament members is 49. Several European prime ministers, including those of Finland and Denmark, took office in their 30s or early 40s, reflecting a recognition that fast-moving technological and climate challenges require younger leadership. NORTH AMERICA: Canada's cabinet ministers are generally between 40 and 55. Even the United States-often criticized for gerontocratic politics-has begun trending younger, with generational turnover becoming a central political debate. By contrast, Bangladesh is a demographic outlier: one of the youngest populations being led by one of the oldest political cohorts in the world. Age itself is not the issue. Many older leaders have served the country with distinction. But when the entire leadership structure is skewed toward the elderly, fundamental problems arise. First, it leads to policy myopia. Older leadership often favors continuity. Bangladesh needs agility-on digital governance, climate adaptation, labor mobility, and skills for a changing global economy. Without generational renewal, policy risks being anchored in an earlier era. Second, it causes a representation deficit. Bangladesh's young people fill the workforce, shape the digital economy, and drive civic movements. Yet they barely appear in decision-making spaces. This lack of representation widens the distance between government agendas and public expectations. Third, it breeds institutional rigidity. Political parties without generational turnover become stale and overly dependent on patronage networks. Bureaucracies become hierarchical and risk-averse-innovation stalls. Fourth, it leads to democratic fragility. Gerontocracies delay succession planning and discourage internal competition. That increases uncertainty and weakens institutions-conditions Bangladesh can ill afford. Bangladesh can still course correct. The demographic mismatch is real but not irreversible. A few measures suggest themselves. First, adopt age and term limits. Many democracies expect leaders to step aside by their early 60s. Bangladesh's political parties and institutions need similar norms to ensure turnover and prevent leadership bottlenecks. Second, introduce youth quotas in party leadership. Gender quotas expanded women's representation in South Asia; youth quotas could do the same for the next generation. Setting aside 20-30 percent of leadership positions for those under 40 would create real openings. Countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia already use youth quotas, and Sweden's political parties maintain youth targets with considerable success. But quotas must come with standards-education, experience, and training-to ensure that youth inclusion strengthens governance rather than diluting it. Third, modernise the bureaucracy. Bangladesh should end the routine reappointment of retired civil servants. When expertise is needed, retired officers can serve as advisers, not line managers-mirroring practices in Japan. At the same time, the statutory retirement age should be updated to reflect longer life expectancy and international standards. And the civil service should expand lateral entry, technical specialisation, and competitive mid-career recruitment. These reforms would build a more dynamic administrative corps and prevent the system from becoming a revolving door for former officials. Fourth, make Parliament younger. Lowering campaign costs, expanding public financing, and tightening political funding rules would allow younger, less affluent candidates to compete on a level field. Finally, institutionalise succession planning. Political parties need real leadership pipelines and mentoring structures. Youth wings must be more than decorative units reserved for rallies. Bangladesh's greatest asset is its youth. Yet its leadership structure increasingly reflects the demographic profile of a much older nation. At a time when the country faces economic headwinds, institutional transition, and shifting geopolitical realities, it needs leaders who can think toward 2050, not toward the back 1990. Gerontocracy is not destiny. But it is a warning. Bangladesh now faces a choice: continue on a path where age outweighs energy or build a political culture that matches the ambition and imagination of its young citizens. The future belongs to them. Bangladesh's politics should, sooner or later, follow. Dr M G Quibria is an economist and former senior adviser at the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI). mgquibria.morgan@gmail.com The opinion expressed in the article is strictly personal. Non-performing loans, commonly known as NPLs, are often discussed as if they represent a moral failure of the banking system. In reality, they are a standard business outcome of lending, embedded in the structure of modern finance. Banking is not the business of certainty; it is the business of calculated risk. Banks lend against expectations of future cash flows, market stability, and borrower behaviour, none of which can ever be guaranteed. As a result, a portion of loans will inevitably fall into distress. This is neither abnormal nor undesirable. A certain level of NPLs is a natural outcome of economic activity and, paradoxically, a sign that banks are supporting growth rather than remaining overly risk-averse. Globally accepted banking practice is built on this understanding. That is why tools such as loan rescheduling, restructuring, refinancing, and rehabilitation exist. These mechanisms are not extraordinary concessions; they are routine instruments designed to manage outcomes when credit does not perform as planned. Rescheduling addresses temporary liquidity stress, while restructuring aligns debt obligations with revised business realities. When applied prudently, these tools preserve economic value, protect bank balance sheets, and allow viable businesses to recover from shocks. In this sense, NPLs are part of the normal risk anatomy of banking, alongside credit, liquidity, and market risks. Expecting a zero-NPL banking system is not prudent; it is a denial of how economies function. When loans become non-performing due to genuine economic or business reasons, they remain firmly within the scope of banking and regulatory management. Banks classify such loans, maintain provisions, intensify recovery efforts, and, when necessary, write them off transparently. Regulators define the rules, supervise compliance, and ensure losses are recognised rather than hidden. A healthy financial system is not defined by the absence of NPLs, but by its ability to identify stress early, absorb losses, and resolve problems efficiently. Excessive fear of NPLs often leads to extreme risk aversion, restricting credit to productive sectors and slowing economic growth. Supporting genuine NPL resolution is therefore not leniency; it is sound economic management. This logic, however, collapses the moment default becomes wilful. A borrower who has the capacity to repay but deliberately chooses not to, or who diverts funds, falsifies information, or exploits regulatory loopholes, is not participating in a normal credit cycle. Such behaviour does not belong in the category of NPLs arising from business stress. Wilful default is fundamentally different in nature, and treating it as just another non-performing loan is a serious conceptual and policy mistake. It is not a banking inconvenience; it is a breach of trust and, in many cases, financial misconduct. An NPL reflects inability to pay; wilful default reflects unwillingness to pay despite ability. When these two are grouped, accountability disappears. Repeated rescheduling or cosmetic restructuring of wilful default cases does not resolve the problem; it institutionalises it. It sends a dangerous signal that deliberate non-repayment carries limited consequences, turning default into a calculated business strategy rather than an economic failure. Once intent to evade repayment or misuse funds is established, the issue should move beyond balance-sheet treatment into legal and punitive domains. Without this distinction, the entire NPL framework becomes distorted. This distinction becomes even more critical when one considers a basic but often overlooked fact: banks primarily lend public money. Deposits placed by individuals, businesses, and institutions form the core funding base of the banking system. When a borrower wilfully defaults, the loss is not borne by an abstract balance sheet; it represents misappropriation of public money. Depositors, taxpayers, and ultimately the wider public absorb the cost through weakened banks, reduced credit availability, and, in extreme cases, state-funded recapitalisation. Viewed through this lens, wilful default is not merely a private dispute between a bank and a borrower. It is a matter of public interest. The protection of depositors’ funds and the integrity of the financial system impose a clear obligation on policymakers and the legal system to intervene decisively. Banks can initiate recovery actions, but they cannot investigate fraud, seize assets at scale, or impose criminal sanctions. That responsibility lies squarely with the state. Bangladesh’s banking sector illustrates why this public-interest perspective is essential. Over the past decade, the country has experienced a persistent and now accelerating rise in defaulted loans. According to Bangladesh Bank data, total defaulted loans exceeded Tk 6.4 trillion in 2025, pushing default ratios to historically unprecedented levels. While global shocks and domestic economic pressures have contributed, the scale and persistence of the problem point to structural weaknesses rather than temporary stress. This is not a purely cyclical phenomenon driven by inflation, exchange-rate volatility, or post-pandemic adjustment. The accumulation of bad loans over time reflects systemic gaps in credit governance, enforcement, and accountability. High NPL levels constrain banks’ lending capacity, erode profitability, and weaken confidence among depositors and investors. Over time, this undermines financial intermediation and slows economic growth. Regional and global comparisons further highlight the seriousness of the issue. In most developing and neighbouring economies, NPL ratios are typically contained within a range of 2 to 6 per cent. Advanced economies often operate with ratios below 2 per cent. Even countries that have experienced severe banking crises have managed to reduce NPLs through decisive reforms, strong legal enforcement, and specialised resolution frameworks. Bangladesh’s significantly higher ratios suggest not just economic stress, but institutional tolerance for weak repayment discipline. Within this broader NPL picture, the rise of wilful default is particularly damaging. Although precise data remain limited, multiple investigations and disclosures indicate that a substantial share of large defaults involve repeat borrowers, fund diversion, or strategic non-payment. These cases are often concentrated among borrowers with sufficient influence or access to exploit weak enforcement mechanisms. The result is a skewed system in which honest borrowers face tighter credit and higher costs, while deliberate defaulters face limited consequences. The economic cost of this imbalance is significant. Wilful defaults lock up scarce capital, distort credit allocation, and weaken banks’ ability to support productive sectors. Depositors bear the risk indirectly through weaker institutions, while taxpayers may ultimately bear the burden through recapitalisation or implicit guarantees. Over time, this erodes trust in the financial system and damages the broader economy. It is therefore essential to recognise that not all defaults are banking problems of the same kind. Genuine NPLs can largely be managed at the bank level with regulatory support. Improved credit appraisal, early warning systems, realistic provisioning, and transparent reporting can significantly reduce their impact. Regulators can strengthen supervision and discourage practices such as loan evergreening or repeated rescheduling without recovery prospects. These are technical and managerial challenges, and banks are structurally equipped to address them. Wilful default, by contrast, cannot be resolved by banks acting alone. Banks are custodians of public funds, not enforcement agencies. Expecting them to recover misappropriated public money without strong legal backing is unrealistic. Once wilful intent is established, responsibility must shift decisively to policymakers, regulators, courts, and law enforcement agencies. Asset tracing, seizure, prosecution, and timely adjudication are essential to restore deterrence and public confidence. Bangladesh’s NPL challenge is therefore not merely a banking sector issue; it is an economy-wide governance issue. Weak contract enforcement, prolonged legal processes, regulatory forbearance, and inconsistent policy signals create an environment where default is insufficiently penalised. Banks operate within this ecosystem; they do not define it. Expecting the banking industry to resolve a problem rooted in legal, political, and institutional structures is neither realistic nor fair. Policymakers must shoulder primary responsibility. Strengthening insolvency and recovery laws, ensuring fast-track resolution of large default cases, clearly defining and publicly identifying wilful defaulters, and insulating credit decisions from undue influence are critical steps. Without strong legal and policy support, even the most disciplined banking reforms will have limited impact. In conclusion, non-performing loans arising from genuine reasons should be recognised as a natural and manageable outcome of banking activity and supported through structured, transparent resolution mechanisms. Wilful default, however, is a clear case of public money misappropriation and must be treated as such. Bangladesh’s experience demonstrates the danger of blurring this distinction. Unless policymakers and the legal system take decisive ownership of the issue in the interest of the public, the NPL burden will continue to grow, threatening not only the banking system but the stability of the entire economy. The writer is Professor, Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM), Dhaka. ahsan@bibm.org.bd The “Digital Bangladesh” slogan, which emerged in 2009, echoed a collective dream of embracing technology across all aspects of life. The dream had a modest yet revolutionary vision: to “connect people and enable digital inclusion to reach out to all Bangladeshis.” In its first stage, it has achieved this goal phenomenally. “Mobile penetration has crossed over 95 per cent. Broadband has penetrated beyond urban areas. E-services have begun even in government institutions. Digital literacy has begun to spread.” The “click and pay” experience is a reality for a generation that had to spend hours to avail themselves of a utility bill and/or a passport. However, history is not a reward for those who rest on their laurels in the middle of a journey. The world Bangladesh is confronting today is more complex and competitive than it had envisioned when it decided to digitalise itself. The world is undergoing a radical shift driven by AI, blockchain technology, cloud computing and the platform economy. The nation is no longer required to connect its people but to make its people competitive. In other words, it needs to convert a digital connection into a digital advantage. That is Digital Bangladesh 2.0. It is a shift in strategy for a nation to shift from users to producers. The New Imperatives of the Digital Age: The second stage of the digital journey in Bangladesh is characterised by a different logic and a more ambitious vision. The earlier journey in Bangladesh was primarily about infrastructure and inclusion – enabling people to have internet access at home and the presence of mobile banking and e-government services. The new vision is to infuse digital intelligence in all its layers. The essence of this shift centers on the imperative of competitiveness. The world is undergoing a change in its economy driven by big data, AI services and cloud computing. As a country that needs to survive in this new economy, Bangladesh needs to transform from a technology consumer to a producer. The youth and innovative spirit of Bangladesh provide a platform for this shift. However, this will depend on investments in human resources and infrastructure. But it is equally important to speak about platform governance, not just online governance. The old e-government strategy focused on digitising paperwork. The new digital governance vision imagines a state that is a network of platform-based information systems. In this vision, technology is a deep-enabling factor rather than a surface-level one. The second fundamental imperative is financial transformation. Although Bangladesh’s success in m-money services like bKash and Nagad has won many accolades, it is essential to build on this strength and develop a more integrated digital finance ecosystem with interoperable payments, an instant payment system and more. Education and human capital system must undergo a shift as well. While a digitally networked society is important, a digitally skilled society is essential. The education system at all levels needs to transform itself so that it imparts not only literacy but also coding fluency, data analysis fluency, AI fluency and design thinking fluency. Otherwise, infrastructure development will not ensure competitiveness. Fourth and last, cybersecurity and data governance will have to establish public trust. As more and more critical information is placed online, citizens will not accept digital systems until they can trust that all information is secure. The establishment of that trust is not a tangential detail in this project. Instead, it is fundamentally central to all that follows. Governance Re-Imagined: The government of Bangladesh has already prepared a comprehensive National Digital Transformation Strategy (2025-2030) draft to digitally transform more than 800 government services and develop a unified architecture for data and governance. The strategy is to create a common platform in Bangladesh, known as the Bangladesh National Digital Architecture (BNDA) and the National Data Exchange (NDX), to connect isolated databases and ensure seamless service delivery. This strategy will deliver efficient, transparent governance. The role of AI will be pivotal to this new system of governance. Just think of feedback mechanisms where AI can quickly analyse citizen complaints. Or predictive systems that can foretell where corruption is likely to occur. Or an AI-based analysis that can help inform policymaking, not just based on bureaucratic intuition. AI can sharply improve administrative response and cause little human resistance. Similarly revolutionary is its application in transparency. The blockchain can ensure that land registries are secure, that supply chains and expenditures are legitimate and that medical information is recorded with absolute immutability. Making transactions transparent increases transparency and reduces corruption. There have already been some pilots testing blockchain in healthcare and logistics. There is also a cloud-native government infrastructure emerging as a key enabler. With cloud computing, governments can share digital resources and benefit from cost reduction and enhanced security. However, a cloud computing strategy needs to apply robust principles of information governance to avert abuse and breaches. But innovations are challenged. Institutional resistance, silos within government offices and scattered databases remain significant hurdles. The absence of coordination and a culture of accountability can make technology a mere cover for an inefficient system. To effect meaningful change, the system of governance has to transform from a hierarchical structure to a digital, collaborative framework where information can move easily between agencies and decisions are made based on intelligence, not ignorance. If it is done correctly, the payoff is enormous: faster, more affordable services for all citizens, transparent procurement procedures, more targeted and efficient subsidy distribution, evidence-based policymaking, and, eventually, rebuilding trust in government. Technology-based re-imagining of governance can redefine citizenship and transform the state from a hindrance to an enabler. Digital Finance and Fintech: One area that is more indicative of Bangladesh’s success in its digital journey than others is its finance industry. It has not even been a decade since mobile banking services have transferred financial power to millions of people who never had to step into a banking hall. The mobile has thus turned into a purse. However, the next level is not about growing more users but is all about creating a comprehensive ecosystem for digital finance. The Bangladesh Bank Interoperable Instant Payment System (IIPS) between banks, fintech companies, and mobile wallets is a critical step in this regard. Cross-provider real-time transfer services can boost trade and micro-enterprises and decrease reliance on cash. The fintech revolution needs to shift its focus to more advanced services, such as credit scoring and micro-lending, beyond basic transaction services. Banks and financial institutions can develop customised financial services for small businesses and lower-income individuals through AI and open APIs. The area where blockchain technology has shown promise is financial integrity. The development of ‘smart’ contracts will enable greater efficiency in trade finance and reduce fraud in public procurement. The role of distributed ledgers will strengthen security and transparency in banking while facilitating worldwide fintech collaborations. However, with opportunity comes risk. The rising dangers include cyber-fraud, identity crimes, algorithmic bias and money laundering. Regulation needs to keep abreast of technological advancements, not stifle them, but provide a resilient ecosystem for digital KYC norms, data regulations, and fintech testing zones. If Bangladesh can implement these factors effectively, digital finance can become a strength for its economy. Together, it can improve productivity, provide more credits to SMEs, create more employment opportunities in fintech services, and enable Bangladesh to emerge as a meaningful player in digital finance export services within its own region. Finance will not only connect people but will empower them. Human Capital for the Fourth Industrial Revolution: No transformation can outpace the people who must carry it forward. The foundation of Digital Bangladesh 2.0 will rest not on machines or codes but on minds. Education, therefore, must be re-engineered to produce digital citizens rather than analog graduates. In its simplest form, digital literacy is still a key consideration. In this regard, digital equity still needs to address rural communities and women. There is a need to invest in rural broadband infrastructure and provide digital centers in rural areas. Moreover, digital literacy skills are required in school curricula. But beyond literacy is a need for more advanced digital skillscoding, big data analysis, network security, systems design and algorithmic thinking. There is a need for institutions of higher learning to develop new disciplines in fields like AI development and big data science. Vocational institutions can provide courses for those who want to pursue digital skills as a trade. The pandemic has revealed how well and how quickly technology can improve teaching and learning. There is no need for this to end. Online learning sessions and certifications in virtual classrooms can provide a level playing field for those in distant and less-privileged regions. Even blockchain-based certifications like “ShikkhaChain” can enhance transparency in academic credentials. Equally important is linking education to employment. Skills must translate into livelihoods. Partnerships among universities, industries, and government can ensure that curricula reflect real-world demands. Internship pipelines, innovation hubs, and startup accelerators can help graduates become job creators rather than job seekers. Inclusivity is a moral and economic imperative. If society leaves half of its population (women) behind in the digital race, its productivity will remain halfway. Gender-sensitive policies and scholarships for women in science and technology, along with a secure online environment, are a mandate for balanced growth. In the end, a competitiveness education has to balance technological capability with ethical sensibility, creativity and flexibility that will differentiate human intelligence from artificial intelligence in the coming decades. Cybersecurity, Data Governance and The Architecture of Trust: The more digital transformation advances, the greater the risk escalates. The same technology that brings people together and enables possibilities can simultaneously expose and imperil. Cybersecurity is not peripheral to Digital Bangladesh 2.0 but its bedrock. The government’s strategy aims to train tens of thousands of cybersecurity professionals by 2030, recognising that a skilled defense workforce is the first line of defense against cybercrime. Yet beyond the workforce, the nation needs a comprehensive cyber-resilience framework that includes regular audits, crisis-response mechanisms and real-time threat intelligence. Equally critical is data governance. As more public and private services depend on digital data, the questions of ownership, consent, and accountability become central. Bangladesh’s proposed Personal Data Protection Act must enshrine citizens’ rights to privacy and clearly define obligations for both the government and businesses. An independent Data and AI Authority, as envisioned in policy drafts, could oversee the ethical use of emerging technologies and ensure compliance with global standards. Cloud computing introduces another layer of complexity. While it enables scalability and cost efficiency, it also concentrates on data risks. Cloud policy should therefore include data-residency requirements, encryption mandates and standards for vendor accountability. However, one of the most intangible and essential aspects of cybersecurity is trust. The citizenry will only adopt digital technology if they can trust that their information will not be exploited and that, when abuse occurs, they will have recourse. The development of trust will require transparency within government and continuous civic education campaigns on digital rights and duties. In the absence of this protective mechanism, even the most sophisticated digital technology is bound to fail. With this in place, Bangladesh can assure that security and innovations are not enemies but partners in development. From Connectivity to Competitiveness: To ensure that Bangladesh can transform its connectiveness into competitiveness, a unified national vision is required that combines technology and human resources. The first instrument is institutional integration in Bangladesh through the National Digital Architecture and the National Data Exchange. Once this is in place in its totality, government departments and concerned bodies can communicate in a streamlined fashion. The second lever is regulatory modernisation. Outdated laws cannot govern new technologies. The government must accelerate the passage of data protection, AI ethics, and cybersecurity legislation. It should also establish agile regulatory sandboxes that allow fintech and blockchain innovators to experiment safely under supervision. The third lever is human-capital upgrading. Schools and universities should embed digital skills into their core curriculum, while industry-academia partnerships should translate these skills into employment. Incentives for research and innovation must reward problem-solving rather than rote learning. Fourth, a growth opportunity is required in the fintech and digital finance ecosystem. Areas that can achieve enhanced efficiency through technological innovation include real-time payments, blockchain-based trade finance and AI-driven microcredit. The country can earn much-needed foreign currency through exporting this tech. The fifth lever concerns sector-driven innovations. The agricultural sector can benefit from AI-driven irrigation and yield predictive analysis; the education sector can adopt AI-based tutoring and blockchain-based certification; and health services can opt for telemedicine and cloud-based health storage. The manufacturing sector can benefit from automation in the RMG industry. In conclusion, a trust framework in cyberspace is imperative and will ensure that a strategy is successful in its endeavors. Moreover, trust in cyberspace will be considered a currency in a new economy and will guide those possessed of it. The Opportunities Before Us: However, if the blueprint for Digital Bangladesh 2.0 is appropriately implemented, the possibilities are endless. The country can skip through many levels of its industrial development and position itself in worldwide value chains as a digital innovation hub. The government can increase its value of tech exports from a few hundred million dollars to a few billion dollars through software development, fintech services, and AI-enabled services. Small and medium enterprises the backbone of economies will have access to lower borrowing costs and electronic commerce services that will help them compete in a global market. There will be transparent, efficient governance that reduces corruption and instills trust in institutions. The area where a profound shift will occur is in employment. Youth with digital power will have opportunities for freelance work worldwide and will make valuable contributions to global ventures through collaborative project development. Digital inclusion will thus transform rural Bangladesh into ventures and initiatives that bridge the productivity gap between rural and urban areas through digital opportunities such as e-learning and rural healthcare. In sum, Digital Bangladesh 2.0 promises not only economic dividends but a social renaissance a nation more confident, transparent and equitable. Risks and Realities: Every revolution carries its countercurrents. The shift to a competitive digital economy will test Bangladesh’s institutions and resilience. Bureaucratic silos, slow procurement, and overlapping jurisdictions could stall reform. Without interoperability and coordination, digital systems may remain fragmented and inefficient. The digital divide remains a stubborn obstacle. Unless rural connectivity, affordability and literacy are addressed, millions could remain excluded from the benefits of digitisation. The divide is not only geographic but also gendered. Women remain under-represented in STEM education and ICT employment, and unless that changes, the promise of inclusivity will ring hollow. The skills gap is a cause for concern. To raise a generation of AI engineers and/or cybersecurity specialists takes many years. If there are not enough opportunities in their own country, this will constitute a new wave of brain drain for Bangladesh. Cybersecurity failures may also affect this. A major hacking incident could reduce people’s willingness to embrace ICTs. Furthermore, delays in regulatory implementation might expose this country to exploitation by large ICT players and/or unconventional digital finance. Finally, technology without ethics is dangerous. Automation may displace workers, algorithms may reinforce bias and data exploitation may undermine privacy. The pursuit of competitiveness must therefore remain anchored in human values and social responsibility. A Vision for 2030: Imagine Bangladesh in 2030, fully realised as Digital Bangladesh 2.0. Citizens access every government service through a unified portal powered by secure digital identity. Payments across all sectors occur instantly through interoperable platforms. Students in rural villages attend world-class lectures online, their certificates verified on blockchain. Farmers use drones and sensors to manage crops, while AI models predict market prices. Hospitals maintain cloud-based patient records accessible anywhere, reducing medical errors and saving lives. In this vision for the future, youth power a thriving technology export sector that spans AI offshoring, cloud development and fintech services, generating billions in foreign exchange earnings. Women hold top positions in science and technology as well as digital entrepreneurial ventures. Startups in Dhaka and Chattogram pair up with those in Singapore, Nairobi and Dubai. Entrepreneurs in rural areas sell goods to the global market via online shopping sites. Cybersecurity is robust, governance is transparent and people feel secure in trusting that their information is protected. The economy is resilient and innovative. The country is no longer a passive observer of global digital trends but a participant and even a contributor. A Shared Responsibility: To implement this vision, all stakeholders must share it. The policymakers have to translate a vision into action. Completing the National Digital Architecture, complying with data protection legislation and working with ethical AI are among the pressing issues. Policymakers must ensure that all digital policies are inclusive and that all districts have transparent infrastructure and development. Industry must match policy ambition with private-sector innovation. Companies should invest in upskilling their employees, adopt secure, interoperable technologies and collaborate with startups to co-create solutions. Cybersecurity and data protection should be treated as investments in trust, not costs of compliance. The academic sector needs to read its human capital for this shift. The academia needs to transform school curricula, develop micro-credentials in new domains and collaborate with industry partners on applied project work. Research needs to address practical problems, such as AI in the agricultural sector and blockchain in trade. The success of each industry is contingent on the others. With vision in policymaking, execution in industry and talent in academia, a country shifts from adaptation to innovation. The Promise and the Pivot: The story of Digital Bangladesh 1.0 was one of access, with millions brought online, services digitised and governance modernised. The story of Digital Bangladesh 2.0 must be one of advantage, where digital capacity translates into productivity, innovation and global competitiveness. The foundation has been laid: a young, ambitious population; infrastructure development in place; development of the startup ecosystem underway; and a roadmap in place. However, ambition without coordination is unstable, and connectivity without trust is meaningless. The key is to blend technology and integrity, innovation and inclusion. If Bangladesh can achieve this synthesis, it will not only enter the digital age but will define it. The digitally empowered Bangladesh will serve as a guiding star for other developing nations. The Bangladesh success will illustrate that a developing economy can easily transform into a vibrant knowledge society through vision and value-driven technology. The writer is a professor of Journalism and Mass Communications at Savannah State University in Georgia, USA. sibhuiyan@yahoo.com In the serious tapestry of modern global economy, few issues are as pressing and complex as the intertwining of debt sustainability and climate financing demands. For developing nations, particularly those on the frontline of climate change, this issue has become a profound challenge that requires urgent attention and innovative solutions. Imagine a country like Bangladesh, which lies vulnerable to the wrath of climate change. The nation faces relentless storms, rising sea levels, and unyielding floods that threaten its very existence. The government understands the need to adapt-constructing barriers against floods, investing in renewable energy, and implementing sustainable farming practices. But these ambitious undertakings come at a large cost. The reality is stark: to combat climate change effectively, Bangladesh and similar countries need a significant influx of funds-a requirement projected to reach several trillion dollars annually by 2030 for developing nations alone. Yet, as they scramble to secure the necessary financing, a troubling pattern emerges. A significant portion of the funds comes in the form of loans, creating an intricate web that ensnares these nations in a cycle of debt. As governments seek to finance ambitious climate projects, they often turn to multilateral agencies, bilateral partners, or even commercial markets. This decision, while seemingly practical, inevitably leads to an increased debt burden, leaving nations grappling with the consequences. The repercussions extend beyond mere numbers on a balance sheet. Every time a cyclone strikes or a flood rages through town, the nation's economic infrastructure-roads, bridges, power plants-suffers devastating blows. As the debris settles, the government finds itself compelled to borrow yet again to fund urgent recovery efforts, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio to alarming levels. The cycle feels endless. Moreover, in the quest for climate financing, essential sectors such as health and education risk being deprioritised. The desperate search for funds may lead governments to overlook pressing needs, doing a disservice to their citizens. As they juggle immediate climate exigencies and the long-term health of their economies, these nations often find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place. Then there's the nature of the financing itself-the harsh terms of loans can further complicate matters. If the debt comes with stringent interest rates and short repayment timelines, it jeopardises the very liquidity that countries need to survive economically. In this precarious environment, the hope for financial returns from adaptation projects is often a mirage, as many initiatives yield benefits slowly over time. So, what can be done to steer these nations towards a more sustainable path? The answer lies in a multifaceted approach that balances the urgent need for climate financing with the imperative of maintaining debt sustainability. A significant shift towards grant-based financing is essential. Rather than relying predominantly on loans, a robust increase in grants would allow countries to address climate impacts, particularly in adaptation efforts. This shift would ease the burden of debt and provide a more stable foundation for progress. International financial institutions and wealthier nations could also play a pivotal role. By offering concessional loans-low-interest, long-term loans-they can help ease the financial pressures on developing countries. Furthermore, the innovative concept of debt-for-climate swaps presents an appealing solution. In this model, if countries invest in environmental conservation projects with certain funds, they could receive debt forgiveness, creating a mutually beneficial partnership. To further mitigate risks, utilising insurance and various financial instruments for risk transfer could protect economies from the unpredictable threats posed by climate change. The implementation of sound financial management and transparency around climate expenditure will ensure that funds achieve their intended impacts, maximizing the benefits of borrowed resources. As the world grapples with climate change, the challenges of debt sustainability for vulnerable economies like Bangladesh have never been more urgent. Policymakers must act decisively to advocate for a restructured global financing framework that prioritises grants and accessible funds over loans. The hope is that these adjustments will not only relieve nations from the heavy shackles of debt but also enable them to meet their climate goals effectively. In this on-going narrative, the balance between debt sustainability and climate financing remains delicate. As we navigate these turbulent waters, the future of countless lives hangs in the balance, reminding us all of our shared responsibility in addressing the pressing challenges of our time. Dr Md. Touhidul Alam Khan is Managing Director & CEO of NRBC Bank PLC and first Certified Sustainability Reporting Assurer in Bangladesh. touhid1969@gmail.com In the landmark G20 Summit on African soil, world leaders converged on digital innovations as a force for inclusive growth, urging ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance to bridge global divides. Despite the absence of the U.S. in this meeting, the Declaration recommitted to \"responsible artificial intelligence innovation,\" open-source ecosystems, and AI readiness for developing nations. In the AI focused session, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a digital \"technology that is human-centric, global and open-source instead of merely finance-centric, national, and exclusive.\" He proposed a Global AI Compact emphasising transparency, human oversight, and safeguards against misuse, announcing India's AI Impact Summit in February 2026, themed \"Welfare for All\". Host President Cyril Ramaphosa from South Africa highlighted AI's role in Africa's industrialisation, endorsing the \"AI for Africa\" initiative to implement the African Union's AI Strategy and a Technology Policy Assistance Facility for national policies. Interestingly, Indonesia's Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka also took this opportunity to warn, \"We cannot let AI create new inequalities where benefits are captured by a handful of people or companies,\" advocating fair partnerships to avoid past industrial imbalances. UAE's Saeed Bin Mubarak Al Hajeri unveiled a US Dollar 1 billion \"AI for Development Initiative\" for African AI in education, healthcare, and climate, stating it would \"bridge gaps and ensure technology serves the continent's needs.\" Amusingly Canadian PM Mark Carney said that the \"world can move on without the United States,\" noting participants represent three-quarters of the global population and GDP for legitimate AI consensus. Australian PM Anthony Albanese echoed calls for ethical AI to foster skills for one million Africans, while the IMF's Kristalina Georgieva urged policies for AI readiness through \"skills development, enabling infrastructure… and taxation that favors innovation without favoring machines over people\". These views lent required support to efforts being made by organisations such as the Global Development Network (GDN) for a Global South-led pivot towards equitable digital transformation and prioritising open innovation over monopolies. The GDN organised conference \"Inclusive Digital Transformation: Social Impacts and Technological Innovations\" drew participants, including researchers, activists and technologists from the Global South and North to explore how technology can drive equitable development. GDN President Jean-Louis Arcand emphasised that \"in the digital era, inclusion means building capacity in the Global South to shape technologies that address local realities, not just adopt imported solutions.\" Asia Development Bank (ADB) Principal Economist Shu Tian also underlined that over the past five years, mobile coverage in developing Asia has expanded by about 156 per cent, reflecting significant progress across the region. In terms of mobile internet use, Tian said that penetration has grown by 5 per cent during the same period, and overall data speeds have increased nearly fourfold, now reaching around 2.2 billion people across the region. Tian said that these advances are yielding tangible benefits. For example, in Indonesia, digitally prepared firms weathered the 2020 lockdowns with far fewer losses, proving digital readiness as a form of economic resilience. The speaker, however, warned that despite these benefits, digital transformation can also widen inequality if not managed inclusively. It was also underlined that \"factors such as demographics, education, income, skills, and digital literacy can exacerbate social divides. Furthermore, automation and digitalisation may displace certain types of jobs, creating new labour market disruptions.\" It would also be worthwhile to refer to another dimension that has come up for discussion pertaining to AI in different parts of the world. Some have drawn attention to the lack of availability of quality data in low-income countries. In this regard it has been pointed out that all AI systems depend on large volumes of high-quality data. Professor Johannes Jutting, Executive Head, PARIS 21 Secretariat, OECD has made some interesting observations-- \"this data feeds the algorithms and trains the models. If you do not have good data, you cannot expect good AI solutions for your problems. And many low-income countries simply lack quality data. By quality data, I mean data that is accurate, timely, interoperable, accessible, and open, which we often refer to as the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. But in many developing countries, state-generated data does not meet these standards. If you visit the websites of some national statistical offices, you find incomplete datasets, outdated information, or limited accessibility. This is a major barrier. You see it across many low-income African countries, small island states, and lower-income Asian countries such as Nepal and others facing similar constraints. However, AI can be used to clean, structure, and make existing data more usable. In that sense, it's a double-edged sword. On the one hand, countries without strong data systems risk being left further behind. On the other hand, AI can also help them overcome some of the very data challenges that have held them back.\" Digital specialist Franck Kuwonu has pertinently observed that AI is reshaping how learners, teachers, and creators engage with education across different parts of the world. A new wave of AI innovation is apparently transforming learning across countries on the African continent - from chat-based tutors to hybrid hubs and gamified farms. Through initiatives such as Digital Skills for Africa, Lumo Hubs, and Luma Learn, innovators are breaking barriers of access, cost, and language to build inclusive, localized learning systems. Another dimension has been referred to by analytical media specialist Yasir Monon who pointed out that technology is a powerful tool, but its misuse is sometimes becoming a clear threat to the Bangladesh society because of use of fake videos and fake audio clips which look and sound very real. It has been observed that \"they operate without fear of consequences because no specific laws exist to stop them. This lack of regulatory structure creates a dangerous space where digital crimes can grow unchecked\". Monon has also drawn attention to the fact that one must not forget the positive aspects of AI - \"it helps doctors diagnose disease. It helps farmers predict the weather\". In addition, Monon has also referred to how political leaders sometimes unfortunately become frequent targets of false manipulation \"during election seasons, deep fake videos appear showing candidates making false or inflammatory statements. These clips are shared to mislead voters, create confusion, and provoke anger. Businesses face similar attacks when competitors use AI-generated misinformation to damage their reputation. Even religious communities suffer when fabricated quotes are attributed to their spiritual leaders, stirring mistrust and sometimes even violence\". This scenario has persuaded many analysts to point out that the economic motivation behind viral substance tends to create a greater down-turn. This normally takes place because of the fiscal connotation. Monon has underlined that people think they \"can earn money from views and engagement\" when they \"prioritise sensationalism over truth. Algorithms frequently promote shocking or misleading content, creating a cycle where harmful material is rewarded with attention. Many young people now see viral content creation as a shortcut to success, choosing it over education or vocational training. However, online fame is fragile, while real skills provide lasting stability\". It is regrettable that Bangladesh is not learning from the positive action taken by the European Union which has introduced the AI Act. This Act is meant to stop the misuse and challenges created by any misuse of AI. China also tightly controls social media algorithms and has implemented strong protective measures. UNESCO's 2021 AI ethics guidelines are also very positive but Bangladesh appears to have unfortunately failed till now to have effectively taken the necessary measures pertaining to transparency, accountability and culpability regarding the usage of AI. Monon has observed that \"Bangladesh still lacks AI-specific laws. Existing cybre security legislation does not adequately cover AI-generated crimes. Many police officers and judges lack the training needed to understand these technologies, making it difficult to process cases effectively. Proving malicious intent requires digital evidence that courts are not yet fully equipped to manage. The government must establish clear laws governing AI usage and penalise those who misuse it. Police need specialised units with modern tools to detect and investigate AI-based crimes. Schools must also prioritise digital literacy, teaching students to think critically about the content they consume. Parents should monitor their children's online activity, encourage offline hobbies, and seek guidance when needed. Community programmes can also support families by offering digital-safety workshops\". Social media platforms must also play a role. TikTok, Face book, and YouTube need stronger moderation systems tailored to the needs of Bangladesh and must remove harmful AI content quickly. Their algorithms should avoid promoting misleading or dangerous material. Technology companies can also help by creating tools to detect deep fakes and adding watermarks to AI-generated content for transparency. Individual users need to remember that they hold important power. By pausing before sharing a shocking video and verifying source through fact-checking websites, they can attempt to help stop the spread of misinformation. Choosing truth over falsehood is crucial for good use of AI. Technology is a gift that can help Bangladesh progress, but without care, it can be the source of severe harm. AI misuse and viral culture can threaten our safety, values, and future. The time for action is now. With strong ethics, clear laws, and responsible behaviour, we can enjoy the benefits of technology while protecting our society.

    "body": "Bangladesh clawed back from a penalty setback to snatch a point late against a 10-man Hong Kong, thanks to a perfectly placed finish by Rakib Hossain, keeping their Asian Cup qualification hopes faintly alive. Bangladesh had lost the first leg 4-3 at the National Stadium in Paltan on Thursday, leaving them at the bottom of Group C with just two points. Hong Kong remain top with eight points. The point from Tuesday’s 1-1 draw in the return leg at the Kai Tai Sports Park on Tuesday was crucial for Bangladesh to maintain any hope of qualification. Javier Cabrera named Zayyan Ahmed, Shamit Shome, and Topu Barman in his starting eleven. Bangladesh began with a compact defensive structure, absorbing Hong Kong’s early attacks without exposing Mitul Marm. In the 22nd minute, Shomit’s surge was halted as a Hong Kong defender pulled his jersey, before the resulting freekick by Hamza Choudhury crashed into the wall. With Hong Kong relentlessly pressing forward, defender Kazi Tariq Raihan’s miscontrol and hurried attempt to retrieve a teammate’s pass led to a foul on Pereira in the box, conceding the penalty. Matt Orr slotted it home with Mitul Marma diving the other way. Bangladesh narrowly avoided further danger in the 44th minute, as a glancing ball eluded Mitul’s gloves but was cleared by a defender. After the break, Cabrera made two changes, bringing on Jamal Bhuiyan and Fahamidul Islam for Zayyan and Sohel Rana. Fahmidul injected pace in Bangladesh’s attack, firing a powerful shot in the 67th minute, forcing a save by the Hong Kong keeper. Hong Kong suffered a setback in the 75th minute as defender Oliver Gerbig received a second yellow, and Bangladesh took advantage of the thinner Hong Kong backline, finding the equaliser eight minutes later. Fahim’s left-footed cross was met by Fahamidul’s header, laying the ball perfectly for Rakib, who finished with precision. Despite late pressure, Bangladesh could not find a winner, leaving them with the consolation of a point on Hong Kong soil. Neymar will undergo knee surgery after playing through the pain to help Santos avoid relegation with a 3-0 win over Cruzeiro on Sunday, raising more doubts about the winger's chances of playing at next year's World Cup. The 33-year-old returned to his childhood club Santos in January after a stint in Saudi Arabia and had a crucial impact in his team's survival in the Brazilian top flight, scoring five goals in the last four matches. \"I came for this, to try to help the best way I can. These have been tough weeks for me,\" Neymar, who played in only 20 of their 38 league games, told reporters. \"I thank those who were with me to lift me up. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have played these matches because of these injuries, this knee problem. I need to rest and then we will have this knee surgery.\" He did not provide details on the surgery or a timeline on his expected recovery. Neymar has not featured for Brazil in two years due to a succession of injuries. In October, national team head coach Carlo Ancelotti said the forward must regain full fitness if he is to earn a recall to the squad for the Jun 11 to Jul 19 World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Lionel Messi checked a few more boxes on his already impressive resume Saturday. Messi notched a pair of assists as Inter Miami captured their first MLS Cup title with a 3-1 victory over the visiting Vancouver Whitecaps. Messi, who also was named the MLS Cup MVP, set up Rodrigo de Paul in the 71st minute and Tadeo Allende in second-half stoppage time. The 38-year-old Ballon d'Or winner finished the playoffs with a single postseason record of 15 goal contributions (six goals, nine assists) registering at least one goal or assist in all six of Miami's playoff matches while easily posting an MLS record for goal contributions in one season. \"Three years ago, I decided to come to MLS, and today we are MLS champions,\" Messi told reporters after the match. \"We reached the semifinals of the (Concacaf) Champions Cup. Last year, we went out early in the league and were eliminated in the first round. This year, winning MLS was one of our main objectives. \"The team made a huge effort -- it was a very long year, with many matches and we were up to the task all season. This is the moment I had been waiting for, and that we, as a team, were waiting for. It's very beautiful for all of us. They deserved it.\" Messi deserved it, too, and there's likely more in store. With 29 goals and 19 assists, Messi was one goal contribution shy of the league-record 49 set by Los Angeles FC legend Carlos Vela in 2019 and could be the first back-to-back MVP in league history. \"I'm very happy for him,\" first-year Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano said. \"I'm very happy because of the season that he played. ... For him it was very, very special and very important to win this trophy. He came here to win this trophy.\" A British man on Wednesday pleaded guilty to criminal charges over the incident in which a car ploughed into a crowd of Liverpool soccer fans during May's Premier League title victory parade. Paul Doyle, 53, sobbed in the dock at Liverpool Crown Court as he changed his pleas to guilty, having pleaded not guilty in September. Bangladesh have edged India 1-0 in a tense AFC Asian Cup qualifier to claim a victory over their neighbours after 22 years, thanks to a deft first-half strike by Sheikh Morsalin. In the 12th minute, midfielder Rakib whipped the ball into the box, where Morsalin burst through and toe-poked it past Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu to put Bangladesh ahead at the National Stadium on Tuesday, bdnews24.com reports. The goal sparked wild celebrations inside the stadium. The remainder of the match saw Bangladesh fiercely defend their lead against a desperate Indian attack, holding on to claim the narrow win in the second leg of the third round of Asian Cup qualifiers. Bangladesh’s last victory over India came in the 2003 SAFF Championship, when goals from Rokonuzzaman Kanchan and Matiur Rahman Munna sealed a 2–1 victory. The win also lifted Bangladesh from the frustration of a winless qualifying campaign. Captain Jamal Bhuiya, though sidelined from playing, witnessed his team break through a long spell of disappointment and savoured the moment of triumph.",

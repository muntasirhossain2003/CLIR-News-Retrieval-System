    "body": "Domestic aide Ayesha Akhter has given a confessional statement to the court in connection with the murder of a mother and her teenage daughter in Dhaka’s Mohammadpur, after her husband confessed earlier. Dhaka Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Jashita Islam recorded her confessional statement following an application by the investigation officer. Police arrested key suspect Ayesha and her husband, identified only as Rabbi, on Dec 10 around 12:30pm from her aunt-in-law’s house in Nalchity Upazila of Jhalakathi. The following day, the court ordered six days of questioning in police custody for Ayesha and three days for Rabby. Rabby gave a confessional statement in court on Sunday following his police interrogation. After Ayesha’s six-day remand ended on Wednesday, Mohammadpur Police Sub-Inspector Shahidul Osman Masum produced her in court. As she agreed to make a statement, police applied to have it recorded. The court later sent her to jail, Prosecution Police Sub-Inspector Mizanur Rahman said. The double murder took place on Dec 8, when 48-year-old Laila Afroze and her 15-year-old daughter Nafisa Lawal Binte Aziz were found dead with their throats slit at their home. CCTV footage shows only her entering and leaving the apartment before and after the killings. Laila’s husband Azizul Islam filed a case with Mohammadpur Police on the night of the incident. Police announced the arrest of Ayesha and her husband two days later. Azizul, the plaintiff in the case, is a physics teacher at Sunbeams School. He had been living in the Mohammadpur flat with his wife and their only daughter for about 13 years. Their village home is in Natore. On the day of the incident, Azizul left home in the morning as usual for school. He returned earlier than usual because exams were being held. Around 11am, he found the bodies of his wife and daughter. Hearing his screams, neighbours gathered and informed police. Police said CCTV footage shows Ayesha, aged around 20, entering the flat at 7:51am wearing a burqa and leaving at 9:36am wearing a school uniform that belonged to ninth-grader Nafisa. After the killings, police questioned the building’s doorman, identified only as Khalek. He told investigators that he had sent the young woman to the flat when she came to the house for work four days earlier, adding that she was not known to him. Based on CCTV footage and information obtained from the doorman, police said Khalek allowed Ayesha to enter the building naturally when she arrived after 7am. When she left wearing a school uniform and a face mask, he, however, failed to recognise her. The court has ordered police to submit the investigation report by Jan 13. Singapore’s Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has said that the condition of Sharif Osman Hadi, spokesperson of Inquilab Moncho, is very critical. At around 9:40 pm on Wednesday, Dr Balakrishnan called Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus and briefed him on Hadi’s medical condition and ongoing treatment. During the conversation, he said Hadi’s condition remains extremely critical, according to the CA’s Press Wing. Earlier, Dr Balakrishnan visited Sharif Osman Hadi, a frontline fighter of the July Uprising who is currently receiving treatment in Singapore. The Chief Adviser urged the people of the country to remain calm and requested everyone to pray and offer supplications for Hadi’s recovery. Earlier on Monday, an air ambulance equipped with all emergency facilities for a critical patient, departed Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport carrying Hadi, who was shot in the head from close range in an assassination attempt last Friday, to Singapore for advanced treatment. Nearly two-thirds of child labourers in Bangladesh are employed in industrial and factory settings, exposing them to serious health and safety risks, a report said on Wednesday. The findings were presented at an event in Dhaka jointly organised by the International Organisation Educo Bangladesh and the Child Labour Elimination Platform (CLAP). Economist Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem presented the policy recommendations, while Educo Bangladesh Country Manager Afzal Kabir Khan chaired the session. Speakers at the event stressed the need to strengthen social protection measures to prevent child labour and provide adequate support to affected families. The report revealed that 66.6 percent of child labourers are engaged in the industrial sector, while 44.4 percent work in services and 38.8 percent in agriculture. Many of these children are exposed to hazardous conditions that pose serious threats to their physical and mental wellbeing. According to the data, hazardous child labour is most prevalent in the industrial sector, accounting for 54.7 percent of cases. The service sector follows with 29.9 percent, while agriculture accounts for the lowest share at 3.3 percent of children engaged in dangerous work. Dr Moazzem said that despite international commitments, existing laws and social protection mechanisms, millions of children remain engaged in labour, particularly in the informal sector. He mentioned that around 3.5 million children are involved in various forms of work, but official data is available for only 1.7 million of them. Of this number, about 100,000 children are engaged in hazardous occupations. He said child labour is more visible in urban areas due to the availability of diverse job opportunities, but rural child labour remains significant, particularly in agriculture and seasonal work. To address the problem effectively, he recommended increasing budgetary allocations to social protection programmes and expanding their coverage to reach vulnerable families. Md Kamal Uddin Biswas, additional secretary of the Ministry of Social Welfare, said the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) explicitly call for ending child labour, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against children. He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to achieving the SDG targets. He added that several initiatives, projects and programmes have already been undertaken by different ministries and departments to eliminate child labour. The government, he said, would take steps to implement recommendations aimed at bringing out-of-school children under social protection schemes and increasing allocations in this sector. Associate Professor Md Aurangzeb Akand of Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University stressed the need for universal child benefits and adequate social protection systems. He called for increased investment in quality education and urged authorities to bring all out-of-school children back into classrooms. He also emphasised greater spending on child protection, agricultural development, rural public services, infrastructure and livelihoods. Afzal Kabir Khan said that eliminating child labour requires a robust and inclusive social protection system. He underscored the importance of reducing gaps in coverage, expanding social safety net programmes and strengthening support for the families of child labourers to address the root causes of the problem. Dhaka Metropolitan Police arrested 392 people in 24 hours under Operation Devil Hunt Phase-2 from 1 am to 11.59 pm on Tuesday (December 16) at various locations in the capital. Among those arrested were 15 active leaders and activists of the Awami League and its affiliated organisations, along with 377 individuals wanted in various cases or held on existing warrants with warrants, said Talebur Rahman, Deputy Commissioner (Media) of DMP. The operation was carried out as part of the ongoing efforts to maintain normal law and order in the capital. In addition, special checkposts were set up at eleven entry and exit points of the capital from 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm on Wednesday (December 17) to search suspicious vehicles and ensure public safety. During this operation, 769 vehicles were searched and five people were arrested. The DMP’s ongoing operation will continue to ensure law and order in the capital, DC Talebur added. Civil society, political leaders, and researchers expressed deep concern Wednesday over the deterioration of public safety and the weakness of the judicial system in Bangladesh. At a dialogue titled “Security and Rights: What We Want, What We Get?” organized by Democracy International, speakers stressed that ensuring citizens’ safety and rights cannot rely on a single party. They called for national unity, political accountability, and effective institutional reforms. Catherine Cecil, Chief of Party at Democracy International, cited a survey conducted from November 5–30, before the shooting of Osman Hadi, showing 92.3% of respondents would not vote for any party or candidate involved in violent acts. About half believed political parties are failing to curb violence and establish peace. Other speakers highlighted the human impact of political violence, weak law enforcement, and the need for impartial governance. Faruk Hasan of the Gonadhikar Parishad said 24 years of politically motivated violence has eroded public safety and the rule of law. Monira Sharmin of NCP emphasized building consensus beyond election-focused politics, while BNP’s ABM Mosharraf Hossain stressed accountability and professionalism in law enforcement to protect innocent citizens. Experts also noted the gendered aspect of insecurity. University of Dhaka Professor Dr. Salma Akter said fear of violence affects women in both public and private spaces. Human rights activist Noor Khan Liton called for consistent attention to human rights beyond election periods. Speakers concluded that safeguarding public safety requires national unity, sustained political will, and state support to ensure citizens can live without fear and the rule of law is upheld. The dialogue was held under the B-Space project with support from FCDO and organized by Democracy International in collaboration with Jamuna Television.",

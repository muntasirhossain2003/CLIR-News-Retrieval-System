    "body": "Germany's financial regulator BaFin on Monday announced stricter oversight of Berlin-based online bank N26, including limits on new business in the Netherlands and the instalment of a special monitor, after finding lapses in compliance by the lender. The measures mark the second time since 2021 that BaFin has ordered a special monitor to oversee the fast-growing Berlin-based bank, and they amount to a significant crackdown on a prominent name in finance in Europe's largest economy. The lender, one of Europe's most valuable financial startups, has seen tumultuous times in recent months, with an array of management and supervisory board changes. N26 said that it was \"in close and constructive communication with the supervisory authorities as well as the appointed special representative\". Among the orders announced on Monday, BaFin prohibited N26 from offering new mortgages in the Netherlands and required the bank to hold more capital. BaFin said that a special audit in 2024 revealed issues. \"There were serious deficiencies, particularly in risk and complaint management and in the organization of the lending business. The institution thus violated the provisions of the German Banking Act,\" BaFin said. N26, founded in 2013, says it has 5 million customers in 24 countries in Europe. It has raised nearly $1.8 billion from investors, including insurer Allianz, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, Chinese internet group Tencent, venture capital firm Earlybird and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. In August, one of the original founders, Valentin Stalf, said he would step down as co-CEO and join the supervisory board. A new chief risk officer was also appointed starting on December 1. The bank this year doubled the size of its supervisory board to six, installing a new chair who once sat on the board of Germany's central bank. N26 ran into regulatory problems in 2021, when it was fined by BaFin for lapses in money-laundering controls and ordered to limit the number of customers it takes on to 50,000 a month. At the time, N26 said it would close its US operations and focus on Europe. The Local Government Division (LGD) under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives has submitted a Tk 9.79-billion-project proposal to upgrade 123.53 kilometres of local roads in 18 wards that were incorporated into Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) in 2016, sources at the Planning Commission said. The Physical Infrastructure Division of the Planning Commission recently held a meeting of the Project Evaluation Committee (PEC) to review the proposal. The committee decided to recommend the project for approval, subject to the incorporation of several observations and revisions. According to a senior official, the proposal earmarks Tk 9.06 billion—about 92.53 per cent of the total allocation—for the development of roads and drains. However, the development project proposal (DPP) does not include detailed designs, drawings, unit costs or the basis of the cost estimates. “The PEC has recommended that detailed cost calculations, unit cost breakdowns, and relevant designs and drawings be incorporated into the DPP before it is resubmitted,” the official said. The committee also raised concerns over the proposed costs, which include Tk 49.7 million per kilometre for roads, Tk 25.1 million per kilometre for drains, and Tk 90,000 per streetlight along with related works. The PEC described the estimates as high and asked the LGD to provide justification and supporting data to ensure cost efficiency. An LGD official said that around 360.65 kilometres—nearly 60 per cent—of the 602.37 kilometres of roads in the 18 wards are still earthen and in poor condition, while 241.72 kilometres have been developed under earlier projects. He added that the lack of an adequate drainage system has been causing persistent waterlogging, with even light rainfall creating serious inconvenience for residents. According to the proposal, the project aims to improve the road network in the newly added wards, reduce waterlogging, ease traffic congestion, enhance traffic management, and improve overall living standards, including safer and more convenient pedestrian movement. The proposal also notes that Dhaka, with a population of nearly 20 million, is one of the world’s most densely populated cities and continues to face mounting challenges such as traffic congestion, environmental degradation and rising road accidents. In 2016, the boundaries of Dhaka North and Dhaka South city corporations were expanded, with eight unions added to each. The unions integrated into DSCC are Shyampur, Matuail, Demra, Dhania, Sarulia, Dakshingaon, Nasirabad and Manda. The PEC has further recommended the inclusion of a clear project management framework, detailed technical specifications and cost bases for all major components. It also asked for a coordinated utility relocation plan with no-objection certificates from relevant agencies, environmental clearance from the Department of Environment, and an exit plan outlining post-project operation and maintenance arrangements. jahid.rn@gmail.com Gold climbed 1 per cent on Monday to hover near a seven-week high, supported by a weaker dollar, expectations of interest rate cuts and safe-haven buying due to geopolitical tensions, while silver gained but held below Friday’s record high.

The US Federal Reserve last week delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut in a divided vote, with further easing dependent on the labour market and inflation levels.

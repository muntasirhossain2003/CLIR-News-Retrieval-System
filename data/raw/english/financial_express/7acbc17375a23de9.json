The victim - Arif, identified by a single name - was shot around 7:15 pm on Saturday in the Anarkali Road area and was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital in critical condition, said Tongi East Police Station chief Mehedi Hasan, reports bdnews24.com. Another sales representative, Azad Hossain, who was with Arif at the time, told reporters that they had collected cash from BKash agent shops in Tongi Bazar and nearby areas and were heading to a BKash agent office named J&Sons at Sena Kalyan Bhaban in Tongi Bazar. As they reached the middle of Anarkali Road, three men on motorcycles stopped them and tried to snatch the bag carrying the money, Azad said. “The criminals shot Arif in the chest and struck him with a sharp weapon before fleeing with a bag containing Tk 1,577,000,” he said. Locals rushed to help and took the two men to the public hospital in Tongi. Azad received first aid there, while Arif was later transferred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital as his condition deteriorated. Mehedi Hasan said police visited the scene immediately after the incident was reported and have launched an operation to arrest those involved. A BNP leader has been shot dead in Ishwardi upazila of Pabna. The incident took place around 10 am on Wednesday in the Kamalpur area of Lakshmikunda Union, said Ishwardi Police Station chief (OC) Md Mominuzzaman. The victim, 65-year-old Biru Molla, was the convenor of the Lakshmikunda Union unit of the BNP. Jahurul Molla, 55, who has been accused of the killing, is Biru's cousin, reports bdnews24.com. According to Biru’s son Rajib Molla’s complaint, Jahurul had encroached on some of their brick kilns. Biru and Jahurul had a row over the issue, which Biru later came to regret, Rajib said. On Tuesday, Jahurul dug out soil from their land overnight and sold it. “In the morning, my father went to Jahurul to ask him about the matter, and they had another altercation. At one point, Jahurul fired a gun at my fathe,r and the bullet hit him in the eye. When taken to the Ishwardi Upazila Health Complex, the doctor on duty declared him dead.” Several attempts were made to contact Jahurul over the phone, but he could not be reached for comment.

The notification said the Supreme Court, being the highest judicial institution of the country, requires strict security to ensure the safety of the Chief Justice, judges of both divisions, lawyers conducting cases, and all concerned, said a notification issued on the order of the Chief Justice and signed by Supreme Court Registrar General Muhammad Habibur Rahman Siddiqui. It noted that recently trial candidates, litigants and other unauthorised persons have been entering the courtrooms, creating obstacles to security, a peaceful environment and the smooth conduct of judicial proceedings. Such activities, the notification said, have disrupted the security of judges, lawyers, officials and employees. “For the sake of security, access of trial candidates or any persons other than lawyers to the courtrooms of both divisions of the Supreme Court has been limited and restricted,” it said. The notification also said that any kind of gathering, procession, and carrying of legal or illegal weapons, including deadly weapons, explosives and narcotics, has been completely banned on the Supreme Court premises. The order will remain effective from December 15 to December 31. Legal action will be taken against anyone violating the order, it warned. Lawyers, their assistants, court officials and employees, and trial seekers have been asked to remain vigilant and comply with the directive.

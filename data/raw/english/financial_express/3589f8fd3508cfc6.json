The Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) has detained the father of Faisal Karim Masud, the key suspect in the attack on Inqilab Moncho leader Sharif Osman bin Hadi, as the investigation into the attempted killing intensifies. After the detention, the RAB said it had recovered two firearms from Narsingdi and brought Faisal’s mother to its office for questioning. The information was confirmed around Tuesday midnight by Wing Commander MZM Intekhhab Chowdhury, director of RAB’s law and media wing. He said an object resembling a pistol was also recovered. “Of these, one pistol is suspected to have been used in the attack on Hadi.” RAB’s spokesperson said further details would be shared later. Earlier in the case, RAB arrested Faisal’s wife, his girlfriend, his brother-in-law, a man suspected of owning the motorcycle used in the attack, an associate known only as Kabir, and two individuals detained at the border on allegations of assisting Faisal to flee. An attempted murder case was filed with Paltan Police on Sunday night with the consent of Hadi’s family. Inqilab Moncho Member Secretary Abdullah Al Jaber lodged the case. Hadi rose to prominence during the July Uprising and the movement to ban the Awami League, and had announced his intention to contest in the parliamentary elections as an independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency. He was attacked on Friday while carrying out public outreach at Bijoynagar. Assailants riding a moving motorcycle shot him while he was travelling in a rickshaw, with the bullet striking his head. Gravely wounded, Hadi was rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for surgery and later admitted to Evercare Hospital the same night. Doctors described his condition as “extremely critical”. On Monday afternoon, he was flown to Singapore by air ambulance for further treatment.

In a written reply, Rai outlined figures on cross-border incidents and arrests along the Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal–Bhutan frontiers from 2014 to 2024, as well as month-wise data for 2025.

Since the Liberation War, \"Birangona\" or war heroine Sheikh Fatema Ali has found no respite from humiliation. The wartime rape victim has been continuously neglected and subjected to slander and social stigma. The war crimes survivor has never found peace, nor even a chance to heal the wounds inflicted on her by the occupying Pakistan Army. Instead, she has endured humiliation and ostracisation, and watched her daughter’s family fall apart. Now, nearing the end of her life, Fatema’s one wish is that her descendants do not have to carry the burden of her suffering. The victim of sexual violence in the 1971 war broke down at the launch of the first volume of a planned three-volume anthology on the history of the Liberation War. The first volume of the compilation, titled “Raktorekhay Bangladesh – Antoheen Juddho: Gourob, Bedona Ar Shikorer Itihash” — “Bangladesh, Penned in Blood: An Endless War, a storied legacy of grief and glory” — was released on Victory Day on Tuesday. Fatema was visibly overwhelmed at the event. In brief but emotional remarks, she said: “Today, bdnews24.com has honoured someone as unfortunate as me, and I feel proud. I thank them for it. It has been 54 years since independence. If only the respect bdnews24.com has shown us was reflected everywhere. Being treated with dignity like this brings me to tears.” Her voice breaking, she added: “Please don’t look down on us any longer. Help us live as human beings. Make sure we are never humiliated again. I wanted peace for this country, though I don’t know if God will grant it.” At least 15 people have been injured in a scuffle between the activists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami during a Victory Day event in Bhola’s Daulatkhan. Daulatkhan Police chief Saiful Islam Shikder said the incident occurred at the Ghaznavi Stadium on Tuesday. The Upazila administration organised the event, attended by freedom fighters, families of martyrs, and members of political parties, including the BNP and Jamaat. Jamaat’s Daulatkhan Upazila unit’s Secretary Ashraf Uddin Faruque said they were attacked by the BNP activists without any provocation. The administration and police acted as mere bystanders during the attack, Jamaat alleged. Between 15 and 20 Jamaat activists have been injured during the attack, he said. Local BNP leaders could not be reached for comments. Daulatkhan Upazila Jubo Dal Joint Convenor Jahirul Islam said they found Jamaat activists raising a ruckus at the venue after occupying chairs. A scuffle broke out following a comment from a civil society member that freedom fighters were standing while the anti-liberation force was sitting in chairs, he said. I am a supporter of independence, but Jamaat activists attending the event seemed unpleasant to me, he said, adding that he, however, had no role in the humiliation of Jamaat activists.",

    "body": "Yashasvi Jaiswal's maiden one-day international century trumped Quinton de Kock's 23rd as India clinched the series from South Africa by nine wickets on Saturday. Jaiswal's unbeaten 116, beside Rohit Sharma's 75 and Virat Kohli's unbeaten 65 powered India to the target of 271 with 10.1 overs to spare. They won the series 2-1 after losing the test series 2-0. The teams start a five-match Twenty20 series on Tuesday in Cuttack. De Kock's 89-ball 106 and captain Temba Bavuma's 48 were South Africa's only substantial innings before it was all out for 270 in 47.5 overs. Medium-pacer Prasidh Krishna took the sting out of the Proteas with three wickets in three overs, including de Kock, after India ended a string of 20 lost tosses in ODIs since the 2023 Cricket World Cup semifinals. “I don't think the team has looked at me more proudly after the toss,” India captain Lokesh Rahul said. South Africa, at 168-2 with de Kock and Matthew Breetzke lashing India to all parts, would have entertained thoughts of 350. But Prasidh, who'd had an ordinary series and was conceding almost 10 an over, was persisted with and suddenly came through. He trapped Breetzke for 24 and dismissed Aiden Markram on 1 in the same over. De Kock got his seventh century against India (off 80 balls) in style with a six over square leg but added only six more runs when Prasidh smacked over his off and middle stumps. Prasidh took 3-9 in the spell. “It was really hard for me (in my first spell). I had to think how to get back,” Prasidh said. “I was under pressure after the last game. It's a matter of keeping it simple and being calm.” Kuldeep Yadav cleaned up the tail with 4-41 and the Proteas were restricted to 270. Jaiswal and Rohit cruised in the reply with an opening stand of 155 from as many balls until Rohit's slog sweep misjudged spinner Keshav Maharaj and he lobbed the ball to deep square leg. He scored 75 off 73 balls. Jaiswal raised his ton off 111 balls then Kohli raced to the end with 65 off 45 balls, his 128th ODI half-century, and was awarded the player of the series for 302 runs in three matches. “Just playing the way I have this series has been the most satisfying for me,” Kohli said. \"Feel really free in my mind, whole game is coming together nicely. “You have many phases where you feel doubt. You feel nervous, especially in batting where one mistake can cost you. I'm glad to still contribute to the team. When I play freely, I know I can hit sixes.” Prize money for next year’s World Cup will be 50 percent higher than the previous edition with world governing body FIFA agreeing a record $727 million financial contribution to the tournament on Wednesday. The biggest slice of FIFA’s funding package for the North American showpiece - $655 million - will be performance-based payments to 48 participating nations with the champions taking $50 million and the runners-up $33 million. “The FIFA World Cup 2026 will also be groundbreaking in terms of its financial contribution to the global football community,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement. The 16 nations that fail to survive beyond the initial group phase will earn $9 million while in addition, each qualified nation is entitled to $1.5 million to cover preparation costs. FIFA’s Council also confirmed festival-style youth tournaments for under-15s open to all member associations to commence in 2026 with a boys events followed by a girls competition in 2027. “In recent years, FIFA has stepped up its efforts to boost youth football,” Infantino said. “This is a natural next step.” FIFA Council also confirmed that the 2028 Women’s Club World Cup will be held from Jan 5 to Jan 30. England were left fuming after Australia's Alex Carey survived a caught-behind appeal on day one of the third Ashes Test on Wednesday, with the review technology failing to pick up an apparent nick off the century-scorer's bat due to an operator error. The wicketkeeper, who ended up scoring 106 and celebrating his first Ashes hundred at his home Adelaide Oval, later admitted to feeling a \"bit of a feather\" off his bat when he wafted at a Josh Tongue delivery when on 72. Carey stood his ground when the appeal was turned down, but England were convinced and went to the decision review system. The \"Snicko\" technology, which is operated by BBG Sports, picked up a sound but it did not align with the ball's flight by the bat in the review of the delivery, so the decision stood. \"Given that Alex Carey admitted he had hit the ball in question, the only conclusion that can be drawn from this, is that the Snicko operator at the time must have selected the incorrect stump mic for audio processing,\" BBG told BBC Sport. \"In light of this, BBG Sports takes full responsibility for the error.\" Carey went on to score another 34 runs to help Australia reach 326 for eight at stumps after the hosts won the toss and elected to bat first. England bowling coach David Saker said England were ill-served by the technology -- and not for the first time in the series. \"The boys are pretty confident he hit it. I think the calibration of the 'Snicko' is out,\" the Australian told reporters after England toiled through a sweltering day in the field. \"It was a pretty important decision. Those things hurt. You'd think in this day and age the technology's good enough to pick things up like that.\" Saker said England had been unhappy with the technology throughout the series, without elaborating on specific instances, and might raise the matter with match officials. \"After today, that may go a bit further,\" he said of complaints within the England camp. Carey was glad to soak up his third Test ton in front of friends and family in the sell-out crowd at Adelaide Oval. He said he might have reviewed the caught-behind decision himself had he been given out -- but not with great confidence. \"Well, Snicko, obviously didn't line up, didn't it?\" he told reporters. \"Clearly not,\" he responded, when asked whether he was a \"walker\". The contentious incident came two years after Carey was cast as the villain of the 2023 Ashes when he threw down Jonny Bairstow's stumps in the second Test at Lord's. The run-out was legal but triggered a \"spirit of cricket\" debate, and enraged England fans jeered Carey for the rest of the drawn series. Wednesday's escape may do little to boost his popularity in England but in Adelaide Carey had the home crowd chanting his name and he savoured a standing ovation when he reached his ton. \"You're not always going to be liked. Sometimes it depends which side of the fence you're on,\" said Carey. Bangladesh left-arm fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman became the most expensive Bangladeshi player in Indian Premier League (IPL) history on Tuesday after Kolkata Knight Riders secured his services for 9.20 crore rupees at the IPL auction. Mustafizur, who had a base price of 2 crore, attracted strong interest from multiple franchises, with Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders engaged in a bidding contest before Kolkata emerged victorious. The final price surpassed the previous record for a Bangladeshi player at the IPL auction, set in 2009 when Mashrafe Mortaza was signed by Kolkata for $600,000 - equivalent to roughly 5.45 crore at current exchange rates. The signing marks Mustafizur's sixth IPL franchise. He previously represented Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Capitals and Chennai Super Kings. With Kolkata, he adds another chapter to a career that has made him one of the most sought-after overseas pace options in the league. Mustafizur made his IPL debut in 2016 with Sunrisers Hyderabad and played a key role in their title-winning campaign, taking 17 wickets in 16 matches, including a best of three for 21. Across eight IPL seasons, he has played 60 matches and taken 65 wickets, with a strike rate of 21.2 balls per wicket. He has registered six three-wicket hauls and nine instances of taking two wickets in a match. His most productive recent season came in 2016 with Hyderabad, where he claimed 17 wickets in 16 matches. Australia all-rounder Cameron Green became the most expensive overseas player in the Indian Premier League (IPL), after Kolkata Knight Riders signed him for 252 million Indian rupees ($2.77 million) at the player auction for the 2026 season on Tuesday. Green, who was initially registered as a batsman due to an error, was the subject of intense bidding between Kolkata and Chennai Super Kings before being purchased by the three-times champions. The 26-year-old is the third most expensive player in IPL history, after Indian internationals Rishabh Pant (270 million Indian rupees) and Shreyas Iyer (267.5 million Indian rupees). Green, who previously played for Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru but missed the 2025 season as he was recovering from a back surgery, is set to play in the third Ashes test against England starting on Wednesday.",

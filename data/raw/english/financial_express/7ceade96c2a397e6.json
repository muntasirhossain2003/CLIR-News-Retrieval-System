    "body": "Indian authorities ordered an investigation and offered compensation to victims on Sunday after a fire ripped through a nightclub in the western state of Goa, killing 25. \"I have ordered a magisterial inquiry into the entire incident to identify the cause and fix responsibility\" for the fire in the village of Arpora, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant posted on X, saying six injured people were in stable condition and receiving medical care. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to Sawant and offered condolences to the bereaved families. Modi posted on X that his office would offer compensation of up to 200,000 rupees ($2,200) to each family of the victims and 50,000 rupees to the injured. Police were alerted to the blaze at the Birch by Romeo Lane club at 12:04 am (1834 GMT on Saturday), Goa's police chief told the ANI news agency. The authorities worked through the night to bring the fire under control, and all the bodies have been recovered, ANI reported. Images on local and social media showed firefighters dousing flames and ambulances lining up. Reuters could not immediately verify whether the images were from the nightclub. At least four of the dead were tourists and 14 were club staff, police told ANI, in which Reuters holds a minority stake. Police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Goa, a small coastal state, is a popular tourist destination especially among foreigners, offering beaches and hilly landscapes. About 5.5 million tourists, including 271,000 from abroad, visited Goa in the first half of the year, according to government data. China's defence ministry accused the Philippines on Wednesday of distorting the facts about an incident involving the Chinese coastguard and Filipino fishermen near a South China Sea shoal. Manila's coastguard said over the weekend that three Filipino fishermen were injured and two fishing vessels damaged when Chinese coastguard ships cut their anchor lines and fired water cannon near the Sabina Shoal on Friday, actions the Philippine defence secretary denounced as \"dangerous\" and \"inhumane\". The Chinese ministry defended its coastguard's actions as \"reasonable, lawful, professional and restrained\", and vowed to \"take strong and effective measures\" in response to \"all acts of infringement and provocation\", according to the statement released on its social media account. \"The Philippine side amassed a large number of ships in an organised and premeditated manner to illegally intrude\" into the atoll's lagoon, the Chinese ministry said. \"Philippine personnel even threatened Chinese coastguard on site with a knife,\" it added. The Embassy of the Philippines in Beijing and the Philippines defence ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Sabina Shoal, which China refers to as Xianbin Reef and the Philippines as the Escoda Shoal, lies in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone 150 km (95 miles) west of Palawan province. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a waterway supporting more than $3 trillion of annual commerce. The areas Beijing claims cut into the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. An international arbitral tribunal ruled in 2016 that Beijing's sweeping claims had no basis under international law, a decision China rejects. Thailand is working out how to repatriate up to 6,000 citizens unable to return home through a major border crossing in Cambodia closed as fighting along the contested border extended into a second week, authorities said on Tuesday. The militaries of the Southeast Asian neighbours are clashing at several locations on their 817-km (508 mile) land border, both have said, with no signs of abatement, despite international efforts to negotiate a ceasefire. Cambodia's closure of its checkpoint in the city of Poipet has prevented the return of thousands of Thai workers gathered there amid fighting that has displaced more than half a million people and killed nearly 40 on both sides since last Monday. Hun Sen, Cambodia's influential former leader, has said the closure aimed to protect civilians from what he called indiscriminate firing by Thai forces in the area. But checkpoints were open in areas free of fighting and air travel was unrestricted, he added. In Bangkok on Tuesday, the foreign ministry said Thais in Poipet could seek help to arrange air travel home from the consulate in the city of Siem Reap, the gateway to the Angkor Wat temple complex. It urged others still in Cambodia to contact officials if they needed to leave. Efforts to end the fighting have included calls from U.S. President Donald Trump, who also brokered a halt to a five-day conflict in July by using trade negotiations as leverage. \"The army said there has been continuous fighting across the border line. The situation is still in flux,\" said Surasant Kongsiri, a spokesman of the Thai defence ministry, with fighting reported in eight border provinces. Cambodia's forces would \"continue to stand strong, brave and steadfast in their fight against the aggressor,\" its defence ministry said. There was no international pressure for a ceasefire, Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told journalists in response to a question. \"No one is pressuring us. Who is pressuring whom? I don't know,\" he said, but did not answer a query whether Trump was using the threat of tariff measures to pressure Thailand to stop the conflict. Thailand is now preparing plans to cut off shipments of fuel into Cambodia, defence ministry spokesman Surasant said. It is tasking maritime enforcement authorities with controlling Thai-registered vessels that might be delivering gasoline and even weapons to support Cambodia's armed forces, as an issue of \"primary concern\" for the Thai public, he added. The neighbours have long disputed sections of the frontier, but the scale and intensity of the latest clashes, stretching from forested inland areas near the Laos border to coastal provinces, are unprecedented in recent history. Each side blames the other for starting the fighting. Malaysia will host a special meeting of Southeast Asian foreign ministers next week as the regional bloc tries to re-establish the ceasefire. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim named new trade and economic ministers on Tuesday, reshuffling his cabinet in a bid to stabilise his administration and fill several vacancies arising from resignations and expired senate terms. The Southeast Asian nation has enjoyed steady economic growth and a boost in foreign investment since Anwar took office in November 2022. But his administration has been rocked by internal disagreements among cabinet members and public discontent over rising living costs. Two ministers resigned in May after losing their leadership positions in the premier's party, while a third quit last month due to unhappiness over the federal government's position on state rights. \"There is a need for an adjustment so that the cabinet can work as a team, focus on generating better economic growth and addressing the people's problems,\" Anwar said in a televised announcement. He last made major changes to his cabinet in December 2023 following a dip in opinion polls at the time, amid concerns over the state of the economy, inflation and the slow pace of promised reforms. Malaysia's cabinet comprises elected federal and state lawmakers from both houses of parliament, as well as appointed senators in the upper house. Anwar named Johari Abdul Ghani, who previously served as plantations and commodities minister, as trade minister - replacing Tengku Zafrul Aziz who led Malaysia's negotiations with the United States on tariff issues. Malaysia and the United States signed a deal in October that would maintain US tariffs imposed on most Malaysian goods at 19 percent. Tengku Zafrul's senatorship expired on Dec 2 and he has since been appointed as chair of the Malaysian Investment Development Authority. Anwar also appointed Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir as economy minister and Arthur Joseph Kurup as natural resources and environmental sustainability minister, replacing Rafizi Ramli and Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad after their resignations in May. Anwar further announced changes to the posts of deputy finance minister, as well as human resources, federal territories, and sports ministers. Other key portfolios such as defence, foreign, and home (interior) affairs, however, remained unchanged. Malaysia faces challenges with economic growth projected in a range of 4 percent and 4.8 percent this year and 4 percent and 4.5 percent in 2026, slowing from 5.1 percent in 2024 due to uncertainties around global trade and tariffs. The government is also seeking to implement further reforms to its public subsidy programmes to boost revenue and align economic goals with a five-year plan announced in July. The cabinet reshuffle could also be seen as a turning point for the government ahead of the next general election, which must be held by early 2028. Anwar's coalition was trounced in an election in Sabah state last month, the first in a series of regional votes over the coming months that will test support for the premier ahead of the national polls. With her health failing and an information vacuum around Myanmar's detained former leader Aung San Suu Kyi, her son worries that he may not even know if she passed away. Kim Aris told Reuters he has not heard from his 80-year-old mother in years, and has received only sporadic, secondhand details about her heart, bone and gum problems since a 2021 military coup that deposed her government. And while he rejects attempts by Myanmar's junta to hold elections later this month, dismissed by many foreign governments as a sham aimed at legitimising military rule, he says it could provide an opening to ease his mother's plight. \"She's got ongoing health issues. Nobody has seen her in over two years. She hasn't been allowed contact with her legal team, never mind her family,\" he said in an interview in Tokyo. \"For all I know, she could be dead already.\" \"I imagine (Myanmar junta leader) Min Aung Hlaing has his own agenda when it comes to my mother. If he does want to use her to try and appease the general population before or after the elections by either releasing her or moving her to house arrest, then at least that would be something,\" he added. A Myanmar junta spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment. Myanmar's military has a history of releasing prisoners to mark holidays or important events. Nobel Peace Laureate Suu Kyi was freed in 2010 days after an election, ending a previous long period of detention largely spent at her colonial-style family home on Yangon's Inya Lake. She went on to become Myanmar's de-facto leader after elections in 2015, the first openly contested vote in a quarter century, though her international image was later tarnished by accusations of genocide committed against her country's Muslim Rohingya minority. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the 2021 coup, which triggered an armed rebellion that has captured swathes of territory across the country. Suu Kyi is serving a 27-year sentence for offences including incitement, corruption and election fraud, all of which she denies. Aris said he believes she is being held in the capital Naypyitaw, and in the last letter he received from his mother two years ago she complained about the extreme temperatures in her cell during the summer and winter months. With conflicts erupting all over the world, Aris worries that people are forgetting about Myanmar. He is trying to capitalise on the upcoming elections - the first since the coup which are set to be held in phases from Dec 28 - to get foreign governments like Japan to exert more pressure on the junta and call for his mother's release. \"Because of the upcoming elections that the military are trying to stage, which we all know are completely unfair, and so far from being free that it would be laughable if it wasn't so lamentable, I need to use this small window of opportunity,\" he said. \"In the past, when my mother was held in higher regard by the international community, then it was much harder for people to ignore what's happening in Burma. But since her position was undermined through the crisis in Rakhine, that's no longer the case,\" he added, using the country's former name. Aris, a British national who kept a low profile until a few years ago, maintains his mother was \"not complicit\" in what the United Nations called a genocidal campaign by the military against the Rohingya in Rakhine state in 2016-17. While she was de-facto leader, Myanmar's constitution limited Suu Kyi's power over the military. She admitted that war crimes may have been committed at an international tribunal in The Hague in 2020 but denied genocide. During his trip to Japan, Aris said he met with various Japanese politicians and government officials to press them to take a stronger stand against the junta and reject the elections. Asked what his mother would think of his efforts, he said: \"I think she'd be incredibly sad that I've had to do this. She's always wanted me to not have to get involved. But I don't really have a choice at the moment. I am her son after all. And if I'm not doing it, I can't expect anybody else to do it.\"",

    "title": "Salah returns for Liverpool amid uncertainty over Merseyside future",
    "body": "Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah made his return for the Merseyside club to loud applause and a standing ovation at Anfield during Saturday's Premier League clash with Brighton & Hove Albion. The Egyptian, whose future at the club has been in doubt since his scathing criticism a week earlier, was named as a substitute against Brighton and came on in the 26th minute after an injury to Joe Gomez. Salah had accused the club of throwing him \"under the bus\" and claimed his relationship with manager Arne Slot had broken down in fiery comments that saw him omitted from the squad for their 1-0 Champions League win at Inter Milan on Tuesday. Salah's fiery outburst came after last weekend's 3-3 draw at Leeds United, the third successive game in which Slot had left the 33-year-old, who led the league in scoring last season, on the bench. He suggested during the post-match interview that the Brighton game might be his last for the club. \"I said to (my family), come to the Brighton game. I don’t know if I am going to play or not but I am going to enjoy it,\" Salah told reporters. \"In my head, I’m going to enjoy that game because I don’t know what is going to happen now. \"I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa Cup of Nations. I don’t know what is going to happen when I am there.\" Slot and Salah held what British media called positive talks on Friday after the Dutch coach told reporters he had \"no reasons to not want him to stay.\" Salah departs for the Africa Cup of Nations on Monday. Prize money for next year’s World Cup will be 50 percent higher than the previous edition with world governing body FIFA agreeing a record $727 million financial contribution to the tournament on Wednesday. The biggest slice of FIFA’s funding package for the North American showpiece - $655 million - will be performance-based payments to 48 participating nations with the champions taking $50 million and the runners-up $33 million. “The FIFA World Cup 2026 will also be groundbreaking in terms of its financial contribution to the global football community,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement. The 16 nations that fail to survive beyond the initial group phase will earn $9 million while in addition, each qualified nation is entitled to $1.5 million to cover preparation costs. FIFA’s Council also confirmed festival-style youth tournaments for under-15s open to all member associations to commence in 2026 with a boys events followed by a girls competition in 2027. “In recent years, FIFA has stepped up its efforts to boost youth football,” Infantino said. “This is a natural next step.” FIFA Council also confirmed that the 2028 Women’s Club World Cup will be held from Jan 5 to Jan 30. England were left fuming after Australia's Alex Carey survived a caught-behind appeal on day one of the third Ashes Test on Wednesday, with the review technology failing to pick up an apparent nick off the century-scorer's bat due to an operator error. The wicketkeeper, who ended up scoring 106 and celebrating his first Ashes hundred at his home Adelaide Oval, later admitted to feeling a \"bit of a feather\" off his bat when he wafted at a Josh Tongue delivery when on 72. Carey stood his ground when the appeal was turned down, but England were convinced and went to the decision review system. The \"Snicko\" technology, which is operated by BBG Sports, picked up a sound but it did not align with the ball's flight by the bat in the review of the delivery, so the decision stood. \"Given that Alex Carey admitted he had hit the ball in question, the only conclusion that can be drawn from this, is that the Snicko operator at the time must have selected the incorrect stump mic for audio processing,\" BBG told BBC Sport. \"In light of this, BBG Sports takes full responsibility for the error.\" Carey went on to score another 34 runs to help Australia reach 326 for eight at stumps after the hosts won the toss and elected to bat first. England bowling coach David Saker said England were ill-served by the technology -- and not for the first time in the series. \"The boys are pretty confident he hit it. I think the calibration of the 'Snicko' is out,\" the Australian told reporters after England toiled through a sweltering day in the field. \"It was a pretty important decision. Those things hurt. You'd think in this day and age the technology's good enough to pick things up like that.\" Saker said England had been unhappy with the technology throughout the series, without elaborating on specific instances, and might raise the matter with match officials. \"After today, that may go a bit further,\" he said of complaints within the England camp. Carey was glad to soak up his third Test ton in front of friends and family in the sell-out crowd at Adelaide Oval. He said he might have reviewed the caught-behind decision himself had he been given out -- but not with great confidence. \"Well, Snicko, obviously didn't line up, didn't it?\" he told reporters. \"Clearly not,\" he responded, when asked whether he was a \"walker\". The contentious incident came two years after Carey was cast as the villain of the 2023 Ashes when he threw down Jonny Bairstow's stumps in the second Test at Lord's. The run-out was legal but triggered a \"spirit of cricket\" debate, and enraged England fans jeered Carey for the rest of the drawn series. Wednesday's escape may do little to boost his popularity in England but in Adelaide Carey had the home crowd chanting his name and he savoured a standing ovation when he reached his ton. \"You're not always going to be liked. Sometimes it depends which side of the fence you're on,\" said Carey. Bangladesh left-arm fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman became the most expensive Bangladeshi player in Indian Premier League (IPL) history on Tuesday after Kolkata Knight Riders secured his services for 9.20 crore rupees at the IPL auction. Mustafizur, who had a base price of 2 crore, attracted strong interest from multiple franchises, with Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders engaged in a bidding contest before Kolkata emerged victorious. The final price surpassed the previous record for a Bangladeshi player at the IPL auction, set in 2009 when Mashrafe Mortaza was signed by Kolkata for $600,000 - equivalent to roughly 5.45 crore at current exchange rates. The signing marks Mustafizur's sixth IPL franchise. He previously represented Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Capitals and Chennai Super Kings. With Kolkata, he adds another chapter to a career that has made him one of the most sought-after overseas pace options in the league. Mustafizur made his IPL debut in 2016 with Sunrisers Hyderabad and played a key role in their title-winning campaign, taking 17 wickets in 16 matches, including a best of three for 21. Across eight IPL seasons, he has played 60 matches and taken 65 wickets, with a strike rate of 21.2 balls per wicket. He has registered six three-wicket hauls and nine instances of taking two wickets in a match. His most productive recent season came in 2016 with Hyderabad, where he claimed 17 wickets in 16 matches. Australia all-rounder Cameron Green became the most expensive overseas player in the Indian Premier League (IPL), after Kolkata Knight Riders signed him for 252 million Indian rupees ($2.77 million) at the player auction for the 2026 season on Tuesday. Green, who was initially registered as a batsman due to an error, was the subject of intense bidding between Kolkata and Chennai Super Kings before being purchased by the three-times champions. The 26-year-old is the third most expensive player in IPL history, after Indian internationals Rishabh Pant (270 million Indian rupees) and Shreyas Iyer (267.5 million Indian rupees). Green, who previously played for Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru but missed the 2025 season as he was recovering from a back surgery, is set to play in the third Ashes test against England starting on Wednesday.",

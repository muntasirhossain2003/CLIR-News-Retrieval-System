Ibrahim Al Jarwan, chairman of the emirates astronomical society, stated that the moon of the month of Ramadan 1447 AH is likely to be seen on Tuesday, 17 February 2026, although visibility conditions on that evening may be challenging. Based on astronomical calculations, Ramadan is projected to begin on Thursday, 19 February and may last for 30 days. If Ramadan is completed in full, as anticipated, the UAE’s approved holiday calendar stipulates that the 30th day will be included as part of the Eid break, Gulf News reported. Eid-ul-Fitr is one of the most significant celebrations in the Islamic calendar. The day begins with the Eid prayer at dawn, followed by family gatherings, charitable giving and a variety of community events across the country.",

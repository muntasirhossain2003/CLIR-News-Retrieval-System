Applications are now open. This prestigious Japanese scholarship offers admission to Master’s and PhD programmes for the academic year 2026, with partial financial support and a monthly allowance to enable students to focus entirely on their studies. This international scholarship is primarily aimed at supporting talented students worldwide to fulfil their academic aspirations, particularly those from developing countries, while also fostering cultural exchange and strengthening mutual relations between Japan and other nations. On 25 December 1996, Japan’s Ministry of Education officially recognised the Honjo Foundation as an international scholarship organisation. It was established by Masanori Honjo, founder of Town Limited, who donated 200 million (20 crore) yen in cash and one million company shares as initial capital for the scholarship fund. The Foundation supports students from developing countries who are expected to contribute to their nation’s development in the future. Japanese students are also eligible to receive funding for studies abroad, thereby enhancing global connections and international goodwill.

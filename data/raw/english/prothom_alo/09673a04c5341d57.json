The decision was taken at the meeting of advisory council held at the chief adviser's office with chief adviser prof Muhammad Yunus in the chair on Thursday. Adviser for sports and labour affairs Asif Mahmud shared the decision during a media briefing at the foreign service academy. Chief adviser's press secretary Shafiqul Alam, deputy press secretary Abul Kalam Azad Majumdar, and Apurba Jahangir were also present.

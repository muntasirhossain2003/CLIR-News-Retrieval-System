Later in the evening, Vivian Balakrishnan called Professor Muhammad Yunus, Chief Adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, and briefed him on Hadi’s medical condition. Vivian Balakrishnan told the Chief Adviser, “Hadi’s condition is extremely critical.” According to the press wing, the Chief Adviser has urged the country’s people to remain calm and requested them to pray for Hadi’s recovery.Sharif Osman Hadi, convener of Inqilab Moncho, had been campaigning to contest the election as an independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency.

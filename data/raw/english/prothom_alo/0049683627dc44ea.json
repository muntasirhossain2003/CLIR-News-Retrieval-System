    "body": "Ramadan has arrived once more, a blessed month we’ve eagerly awaited for. Almighty Allah has graced us with another opportunity to embrace its spiritual significance. But what exactly is Ramadan, and why does it hold such profound importance in the lives of Muslims? Ramadan is not only about fasting or praying, it has deeper values in developing human behaviour. This sacred time of fasting, prayer, and deep reflection is not just an opportunity for personal spiritual growth but also a profound reminder of humility, as it calls us to embrace generosity and compassion toward others, grounding us in gratitude and selflessness. The art of Ramadan has always been about sharing love and giving back to the community. How much are we doing it? What should we do to make our fasting effective? Ramadan is not merely about abstaining from food and drink for a set number of hours. It is a profound lesson in empathy, urging us to understand the struggles of those who cannot afford even the most basic necessities. The hunger we experience is a reminder of what millions endure daily—people who go without food and water for far longer than a fasting day. Consider Palestine, a nation enduring decades of hardship, yet its people remain grateful for the smallest blessings, like a piece of bread they never take for granted. Think of the rickshaw pullers, labourers, and countless others who work tirelessly with dignity, yet have little to eat, still thanking the Almighty for whatever sustenance they receive. This holy month is a call to purify our hearts. It teaches us to feel the pain of hunger and compels us to act—to share our blessings with those who rely on our generosity. Ramadan is not just about fasting; it’s about transforming our hearts and fostering a deeper connection with humanity.Ramadan enforces zero tolerance for arrogance This holy month reminds us that kindness and empathy are at the heart of our faith. It teaches us that in the eyes of the Almighty, the rules are the same for everyone—rich or poor. The daily experience of hunger is meant to humble us, helping us understand the struggles of those less fortunate. While the poor tirelessly strive to improve their lives through hard work, they often embody resilience and gratitude, leaving little room for ill thoughts or arrogance. Ramadan calls us to reflect on this humility, urging us to treat everyone with respect and dignity. It is a time to shed pride, embrace compassion, and recognize that true strength lies in serving others and acknowledging our shared humanity. Ramadan is a time to extend our hands to the vulnerable and marginalized communities. It is a month that reminds us of our responsibility to ensure no one goes hungry, especially those who work tirelessly for us—our employees, helpers, and labourers. It is unjust to indulge in the richness of every meal while those who serve us struggle to make ends meet. Ramadan calls us to reflect on our privileges and share our blessings with those in need. This holy month is not just about personal sacrifice but about collective compassion. It teaches us that true fulfillment lies in uplifting others, ensuring that everyone has enough to eat and live with dignity. Let this Ramadan be a reminder to not only feed the hungry but also to advocate for fairness, kindness, and justice in our daily lives. After all, sharing is not just an act of charity; it is an expression of gratitude to the Almighty for the blessings we often take for granted. In conclusion, Ramadan is a time to purify our hearts, practice humility, and embrace the spirit of sharing. It teaches us to empathize with the less fortunate, act with kindness, and express gratitude through generosity. Let this holy month inspire us to build a world rooted in compassion, fairness, and unity. Syeda Maliha Huq is Digital Marketing Officer, Ascent Group, Dhaka.",

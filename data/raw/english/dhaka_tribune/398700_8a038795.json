    "body": "Bangladesh also formally sought the immediate extradition of Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday summoned Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma over allowing former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to make what it described as “provocative statements calling on leaders and activists to engage in terrorist activities” in Bangladesh. According to the ministry, the high commissioner visited the foreign ministry in the morning, where Bangladesh conveyed its deep concern to the Indian government over Sheikh Hasina—currently in India—being allowed to continue making such statements. During the meeting, Bangladesh also formally sought the immediate extradition of Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. The ministry further drew the envoy’s attention to what it said were anti-Bangladesh activities by Awami League members residing in India aimed at disrupting the upcoming national elections, urging New Delhi to stop such activities and extradite those involved. Bangladesh also sought India’s cooperation to prevent suspects involved in the recent attempt on the life of Bangladesh Inquilab Manch spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi from fleeing to India, and requested their immediate arrest and extradition should they enter Indian territory. The government expressed hope that India, as a neighbouring country, would stand by the people of Bangladesh in upholding justice and safeguarding the democratic process. In response, the Indian high commissioner said India looks forward to peaceful elections in Bangladesh and is ready to extend full cooperation in this regard.",

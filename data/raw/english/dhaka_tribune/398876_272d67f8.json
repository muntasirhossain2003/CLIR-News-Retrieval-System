We reject that with deep contempt,' a student says As part of Victory Day celebrations, a group of Dhaka University students hurled shoes at a portrait of former Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islam ameer Ghulam Azam in front of the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (Ducsu) building. The program took place at around 1:30pm on Tuesday. Hisham Anwar, a student of the 2024–25 session at Dhaka University, said: “We hate the Razakars. Various forces are trying to make the Razakars relevant again. Ghulam Azam and the Nizamis opposed the great Liberation War of 1971. Their successors are now opposing this great Liberation War, calling it an Indian conspiracy.” He added: “We have seen that this year Islami Chhatra Shibir organized programs portraying themselves as the true sons of this country. We reject that with deep contempt. That is why, on Victory Day, we have carried out this program of hurling shoes at Ghulam Azam’s face.”",

    "body": "The blockade brought vehicular movement in the surrounding areas to a standstill Jatiya Chhatra Shakti, the student wing of the National Citizen Party (NCP), blocked the Shahbagh intersection on Monday, demanding the immediate arrest of those involved in the shooting of Inquilab Moncho spokesman and Dhaka-8 independent candidate Sharif Osman Hadi. The protesters also demanded the resignation of the home affairs adviser for \"failing to maintain law and order and arrest the accused\". The leaders and activists of Jatiya Chhatra Shakti began gathering in front of the National Museum at Shahbagh around 11am. Later, they moved to Shahbagh intersection and staged a blockade. The blockade brought vehicular movement in the surrounding areas to a standstill. Additional police personnel were deployed to prevent any untoward incident. Abu Bakar Majumdar, convenor of the NCP’s student wing, said: “We demand the immediate arrest of the attackers who assaulted Hadi. We also demand the resignation of the Home Adviser as the law and order has deteriorated in the country.” The blockade by the protesters was continuing as of filing this report at 1:30pm. Sharif Osman Hadi was attacked on Friday in Bijoynagar Box Culvert area of the capital while travelling in a rickshaw. Assailants riding a motorbike shot him in the head and fled the scene.",

Dr Nazrul, who also serves as adviser to the ministries of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment, and Youth and Sports, made the remarks while speaking to journalists after paying tribute at the National Martyrs’ Memorial in Savar at around 7:45 am on Tuesday (16 December). He said the spirit and determination embodied on December 16 enabled the historic July mass uprising, which in turn created an opportunity to rebuild Bangladesh. “The spirit of this day brings a deep sense of gratitude, respect and love for the martyred and injured freedom fighters who, through immense sacrifice, secured the country’s independence,” he said.",

    "body": "The EU will deepen strategic focus in Indo-Pacific to boost stability, security, prosperity, and uphold democracy and international law The European Union (EU) has described Bangladesh as a “key partner” in the Bay of Bengal and the wider Indo-Pacific, reaffirming its commitment to deepen engagement in the region amid growing security and economic challenges. In a policy statement adopted by the Council of the European Union, the bloc stressed that both the EU and the Indo-Pacific face increasingly complex security dynamics. It said the EU would continue to intensify its strategic focus, presence, and visibility in the region to promote stability, prosperity, sustainable development, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and international law. The Council noted that the EU’s geographic presence in the Indo-Pacific—through its outermost regions and overseas territories—underscores its role as a reliable partner. It also emphasized the importance of a coordinated political presence by the EU and its member states. Building on three successful EU–Indo-Pacific Ministerial Fora held in Paris (2022), Stockholm (2023), and Brussels (2024), the Council said it looks forward to hosting the fourth forum in Brussels on November 20–21, which will serve as a platform for strategic dialogue and cooperation. The EU Embassy in Dhaka shared the latest policy document, endorsed by all 27 member states at the EU Foreign Affairs Council, highlighting areas of partnership with the Indo-Pacific, including the green and digital transition, trade and economic security, and security and defence. Launched in September 2021, the EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific provides the framework for engagement across seven priority areas. Progress has been made particularly in three core fields: addressing security and defence challenges, advancing the green and digital transition, and strengthening trade and economic security. The Council also reiterated its concerns over the situations in Afghanistan and Myanmar, and reaffirmed its commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East based on the two-state solution. According to the EU, the Indo-Pacific Ministerial Fora remain a unique platform for fostering region-to-region cooperation, enhancing mutual security and resilience, and laying the foundation for a more ambitious partnership in the years ahead.",

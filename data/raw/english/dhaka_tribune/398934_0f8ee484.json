    "body": "The blockade triggered severe traffic congestion across the area as police barricades were placed on both sides of the road July Oikya on Wednesday blocked the Rampura-Badda road while marching to encircle the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, demanding the extradition of those allegedly involved in the attempted killing of Inqilab Moncho spokesperson and prospective independent candidate for Dhaka-8 constituency, Osman Hadi. The march, led by Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (DUCSU) Social Welfare Secretary AB Zubair, started from Rampura Bridge around 3pm and advanced towards North Badda. However, facing police resistance, the demonstrators sat on the road in front of Hossain Market in North Badda, chanting slogans such as ‘Delhi or Dhaka, Dhaka is Dhaka’ and ‘My brother Hadi—why did Hadi have to die?’ Addressing the protesters, Zubair said they had no intention of moving further with the procession and only wanted to send a message that no one would be allowed to impose dominance over Bangladesh at will. “We are not afraid, and we will not attack the Indian High Commission. Our protest is a peaceful one. But if anyone tries to maintain hegemonic control over Bangladesh, they will not be spared,” he said. The blockade triggered severe traffic congestion across the area, as police barricades were placed on both sides of the road and protesters occupied one side, halting all vehicular movement from Natun Bazar to Rampura.",

    "body": "Near the Pakshi railway station, in the shadow of Bangladesh’s first nuclear power plant — Rooppur NPP — a vital access road had fallen into deep disrepair. Cracked, muddy, and nearly impassable, it stood in stark contrast to the strategic infrastructure developing nearby. This photo story documents the ongoing reconstruction work carried out by a dedicated brigade of laborers, including both men and women, who begin their day at sunrise. With limited machinery and mostly manual labor, they break bricks, carry loads, and flatten the path under the hot sun. These are not just images of construction — they are portraits of endurance, unity, and dignity. Each brick laid is a step forward not only for transportation but for the communities that depend on this road to connect to the outside world. In a place symbolic of Bangladesh’s future energy independence, this humble road is a reminder: progress begins from the ground up. The pictures were taken by Vladislav Shigera, a photographer based in Bangladesh. A Russian citizen, he has a deep passion for capturing Bangladesh’s culture, everyday life, and unique moments through his lens.",

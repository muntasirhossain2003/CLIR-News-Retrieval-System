    "body": "The exact cause of the fire and the extent of the damage will be determined following an investigation, according to the Fire Service Several clothing shops have been burnt in a fire that broke out on the underground floor of a multi-storey building in Hemayetpur on the outskirts of Dhaka. As the blaze was not very intense, two units of the Fire Service managed to bring it under control in a short time, though it took nearly two hours to fully extinguish. No casualties were reported. The fire originated around 11pm on Thursday from clothing shops on the underground level of the four-storey building. Tanvir Ahmed, an officer at Savar Tannery Fire Station, said two firefighting units rushed to the spot upon receiving the information and quickly brought the blaze under control. It was fully doused by around 1am. He said there were several clothing shops on the underground floor, and preliminary assumptions suggest the fire may have originated from one of these shops. A number of shops were burnt, but no injuries were reported. The exact cause of the fire and the extent of the damage will be determined following an investigation, according to the Fire Service.",

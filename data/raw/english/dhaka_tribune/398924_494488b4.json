    "body": "The items were recovered from an abandoned spot in the Banalata residential area The Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police has recovered the motorcycle, helmet and a fake number plate used in the attack on Inqilab Moncho spokesperson Osman Hadi. The items were recovered from an abandoned spot in the Banalata residential area under Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police Station at around 8:45am on December 14. Acting on a tip-off, CTTC members found the motorcycle and helmet in the ground-floor parking area of a house, while the fake number plate was recovered from a nearby manhole. Deputy Commissioner (Media) of the DMP Muhammad Talebur Rahman confirmed the recovery to BSS on Wednesday. CTTC officials said CCTV footage analysis showed that the motorcycle’s number plate had been changed. Investigators said the motorcycle had changed ownership eight times, initially owned by Abdur Rahman before being sold through several individuals. It was later purchased in the name of Mainuddin Islam using the national identity card of Md Kabir, an associate of Faisal Karim Masud, the prime suspect in the attack. The seized items have been handed over to the Detective Branch for further investigation. Sharif Osman Hadi, also an aspiring candidate for the Dhaka-8 constituency, was shot on Friday. Hadi is currently receiving treatment at a hospital in Singapore.",

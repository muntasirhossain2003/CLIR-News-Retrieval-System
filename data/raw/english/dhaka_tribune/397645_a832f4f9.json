    "body": "The main cause of cracked heels is excessive dryness of the skin With winter comes a common yet often uncomfortable problem for many — cracked heels. The condition may start with mild roughness, but in severe cases, cracks can deepen, sometimes causing bleeding. The pain while walking, loss of appearance, and risk of infection make cracked heels more than a cosmetic concern; they are a genuine health issue. With a little care and regular maintenance, however, cracked heels can be effectively managed. The primary cause of cracked heels is excessive dryness of the skin. Cold, dry winter air, insufficient water intake, wearing open sandals, prolonged exposure to water, frequent use of soap, vitamin deficiencies, and conditions such as diabetes can all increase the risk. Often, the skin on the feet becomes so dry and thick that the pressure from walking causes it to split. The first and most crucial step toward relief is regular foot care. Soaking the feet in lukewarm water for 10–15 minutes every night helps soften the skin. Adding a little salt or liquid soap can enhance the effect. After soaking, gently remove dead skin with a pumice stone or foot file — lightly, not harshly — then pat the feet dry. Moisturizing is the next essential step. Apply a good-quality moisturizer, glycerine, petroleum jelly, or foot cream thoroughly, especially on cracked areas. Wearing cotton socks afterwards allows the cream to work overnight. Regular care over a few days can significantly reduce cracking. Several natural remedies also provide relief. Massaging pure coconut or mustard oil into the feet nightly reduces dryness. Honey acts as a natural moisturizer; applying it to the heels for 20 minutes before rinsing helps soften the skin. A scrub made from rice flour, honey, and a little milk can be used once or twice a week to remove dead skin. Aloe vera gel is another effective natural treatment. Caring for the skin internally is as important as external treatment. Drinking sufficient water daily helps prevent dryness, and a diet rich in vitamins A, C, E, and zinc — including carrots, oranges, lemons, nuts, leafy vegetables, and eggs — supports healthy skin. For people with diabetes, maintaining proper blood sugar levels is crucial, as cracked heels can become infected more easily. A few precautions can help prevent cracked heels. Avoid wearing very hard or open sandals for long periods. Apply moisturizer after bathing or before bed. Also, avoid soaking the feet in excessively hot water for too long, as this can worsen dryness. If cracks become deep, cause bleeding, severe pain, pus, or show any signs of infection, it is safer to consult a specialist rather than rely solely on home remedies. Without timely care, even simple cracked heels can lead to complications. With awareness, regular care, and healthy habits, this painful winter problem can be managed easily. In colder months, paying attention not just to the face and hands but also to the feet ensures comfort and overall well-being.",

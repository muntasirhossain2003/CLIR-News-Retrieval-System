    "body": "The cases were filed in 2013 over allegations of illegal assembly, vandalism of vehicles and sabotage at Malibagh intersection A Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted 45 people, including BNP standing committee member Mirza Abbas and BNP chairperson’s adviser Amanullah Aman, in two separate sabotage cases filed with Paltan and Shahjahanpur police stations in 2013. Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Mehedi Hasan passed the order in the morning after Mirza Abbas and Amanullah Aman appeared before the court and sought acquittal. Following the hearing, the court acquitted them of the charges. Advocate Mohi Uddin Chowdhury, counsel for Mirza Abbas and Amanullah Aman, confirmed the development. According to case sources, the cases were filed in 2013 over allegations of illegal assembly, vandalism of vehicles and sabotage at Malibagh intersection. Mirza Abbas and several other BNP leaders and activists were later imprisoned in connection with the cases. Although the two cases originally named 49 accused, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir was acquitted earlier. BNP leader Moudud Ahmed was also an accused, but proceedings against him were dropped following his death. As a result, the remaining 45 accused were acquitted in the two cases.",

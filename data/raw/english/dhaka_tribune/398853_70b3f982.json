    "title": "Pakistani court hands 35-year jail to cleric of banned group for inciting violence",
    "body": "An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced a senior figure of a prohibited Islamist party to 35 years in prison for inciting violence, more than a year after he openly urged the killing of the country’s then-chief justice, according to court officials and a defense lawyer on Tuesday. The convict, Zaheerul Hassan Shah, is a leader of the banned Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan. He was taken into custody last year after a video spread on social media in which he announced a reward of 10 million rupees for anyone who beheaded then-Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa. Hardline religious groups had strongly criticized Isa after he granted bail to a member of the minority Ahmadi community who was accused in a blasphemy case. The Ahmadi faith, which emerged from Islam, was declared non-Muslim by Pakistan’s parliament in 1974. Members of the community frequently face attacks on their homes and places of worship by Sunni militant groups who view them as heretical. Defense lawyer Maqsood-ul-Haq and court officials said the anti-terrorism court in the eastern city of Lahore delivered the verdict on Monday. The sentencing comes less than two months after the Pakistani government outlawed the TLP following deadly confrontations between the party’s supporters and police during a pro-Gaza demonstration. Since those violent clashes, TLP chief Saad Rizvi has remained unaccounted for. Police claim Rizvi escaped to Pakistan-administered Kashmir amid the unrest, which erupted in early October when he was leading a march from Lahore toward Islamabad, the capital of Punjab province.",

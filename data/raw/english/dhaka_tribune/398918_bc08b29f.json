High Commissioner Hamidullah was apprised of India's strong concerns about the deteriorating security environment in Bangladesh. His attention was drawn, in particular, to the activities of some extremist elements who have announced plans to create a security situation around the Indian Mission in Dhaka. \"India completely rejects the false narrative sought to be created by extremist elements regarding certain recent events in Bangladesh,\" the MEA said. \"It is unfortunate that the interim government has neither conducted a thorough investigation nor shared meaningful evidence with India regarding the incidents,\" India conveyed to Bangladesh. India has close and friendly relations with the people of Bangladesh, rooted in the liberation struggle, and strengthened through various developmental and people-to-people initiatives, said the MEA. \"We are in favour of peace and stability in Bangladesh and have consistently called for free, fair, inclusive and credible elections, conducted in a peaceful atmosphere,\" India reiterated. India said it expects the interim government to ensure the safety of Missions and Posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations.",

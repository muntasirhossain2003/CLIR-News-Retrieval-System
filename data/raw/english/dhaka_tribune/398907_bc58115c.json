    "body": "India and Bangladesh are not merely neighbours. These are nations whose history, geography, culture, and economic destiny are deeply intertwined As Bangladesh prepares for its upcoming national elections, the moment offers not just a domestic democratic reset but an opportunity to reaffirm one of South Asia’s most significant bilateral relationships. India and Bangladesh are not merely neighbours. These are nations whose history, geography, culture, and economic destiny are deeply intertwined. For more than five decades, India has stood by Bangladesh through crises and transformations, always guided by a simple principle: A stable, confident, and prosperous Bangladesh is essential for the peace and progress of the entire region. Today, as Dhaka looks ahead to the polls, New Delhi is watching with optimism. India’s interest is rooted not in interference, but in partnership that has weathered disruptions, adapted to political shifts, and consistently delivered tangible benefits to the people of both nations. The recent strain in relations was difficult, but it did not alter the fundamental truth that India and Bangladesh remain natural allies. Rather, it highlighted the need for deeper political trust, stronger institutional cooperation, and renewed clarity about the shared future both countries envision. A relationship built on trust and shared aspirations Since 1971, India’s approach towards Bangladesh has been marked by reliability and continuity. Governments may change in New Delhi and Dhaka, but India’s core policy toward Bangladesh has remained steady: Support Bangladesh’s development, respect its sovereignty, and pursue win-win cooperation. That is why India is today Bangladesh’s largest trading partner in the region, its most important connectivity link to the global economy, and a steadfast collaborator in sectors ranging from power to infrastructure. When Bangladesh faced floods, cyclones, or humanitarian emergencies, India’s assistance always arrived swiftly. When Bangladesh needed energy support, transit access, or medical supplies including during the Covid-19 pandemic, India ensured cooperation. Unrest, uncertainty, and intense political contestation often strain even the closest partnerships. Yet, through this challenging phase, New Delhi neither lectured nor pressured; instead, it kept communication channels open, encouraged calm, and trusted Bangladesh’s institutions and people to find their own path forward. As Bangladesh now returns to a more organized political process and prepares for elections, this restraint demonstrates India’s long standing commitment: To stand by Bangladesh. That approach strengthens not weakens the foundations of friendship, because trust is built when a neighbour honours your agency. Bangladesh today stands at a historic economic turning point. With one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, a young workforce and a rising manufacturing base, the country has the potential to become the region’s next major growth hub. India sees this clearly and wants to partner in that journey. The joint vision for multimodal connectivity road, rail, river, and coastal shipping can turn Bangladesh into a gateway between South Asia and Southeast Asia. Electricity trade and grid connectivity ensure energy security for both countries. High impact infrastructure projects, from bridges to digital corridors, enable faster commerce and deeper integration of supply chains. These initiatives are shared engines of prosperity. When implemented fully, they will benefit millions of ordinary citizens who simply want better livelihoods, easier movement, and stable neighbourhoods. A stable Bangladesh is in India’s vital interest and equally, a stable India is in Bangladesh’s. For decades, the two countries have cooperated closely to ensure that extremism, organized crime, smuggling networks and destabilizing forces do not undermine peace on either side of the border. This cooperation has transformed entire regions. India’s Northeast has benefited from reduced militancy, while Bangladesh has strengthened its own internal security environment. These achievements underscore a powerful truth that security cannot be outsourced and must be built jointly, through trust and collaboration. Despite temporary strains, people to people ties between India and Bangladesh remain remarkably strong. From familial connections to cultural links, from trade to tourism, from education exchanges to joint business ventures, the human bridge between the two societies continues to widen. The youth of Bangladesh, connected to India through digital content, education, work and travel, increasingly see the relationship not through the lens of geopolitics but through opportunity. They see India as a partner that offers access to markets, technology, investment, and skills. They see a future where the Bay of Bengal region becomes a thriving economic community, powered by cooperation not competition. New Delhi seeks continuity in a relationship that has delivered peace and prosperity for both sides. India believes a confident, stable, and forward-looking Bangladesh is the best possible partner and stands ready to deepen cooperation with whichever government the Bangladeshi people choose. The coming months offer a historic opportunity to reset, rebuild, and reaffirm. The world is changing rapidly. South Asia must move forward with unity, confidence, and shared purpose. For that, India and Bangladesh must stand together not out of obligation, but out of conviction. Because when India and Bangladesh walk together, the entire region walks forward.

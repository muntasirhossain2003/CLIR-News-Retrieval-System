Public transport movement on the roads remains relatively low. Ahead of the verdict in the case that sentenced three people, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, to death, the banned Awami League has called for a nationwide shutdown. Police set up the checkpoints along the Dhaka-Aricha highway at Aminbazar. Authorities said the searches aim to prevent any sabotage of the verdict and ensure the safety of pedestrians and commuters. Buses, private cars, motorcycles, and suspicious individuals are being checked. Savar Model police station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Jewel Miah said: “Police are working to ensure the safety of pedestrians and passengers. A checkpoint has been established at Aminbazar, and a mobile team is operating round the clock.

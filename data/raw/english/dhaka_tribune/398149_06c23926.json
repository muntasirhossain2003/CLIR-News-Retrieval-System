    "body": "A human chain was formed at Hemayetpur Padma intersection in Savar, demanding an end to cyber violence and ensuring a worker-friendly environment for women workers. Karmojibi Nari organized the human chain programme on Friday, marking International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. More than a hundred women workers from garment units, tanneries, and other factories joined the programme. The human chain was chaired by project coordinator Hasina Akter Nainu, while project coordinator Rajib Ahmed conducted the event. Speakers said that women workers regularly face harassment, violence, and especially cyber abuse at the workplace. They urged both factory owners and the state to take effective steps to stop these abuses. “Having laws is not enough—there must be proper enforcement and a guarantee of workplace safety,” they said. Speakers included Sheikh Shahnaz, General Secretary of the Garments and Industrial Workers Alliance; Al-Zahid, Project Officer of Karmojibi Nari; Rabeya Akter, Chair of the NCCWE Women’s Committee; and Nargis Akter, General Secretary of Darus Salam Thana National Workers Alliance. They expressed hope that increased awareness and improved working conditions will boost women workers’ productivity and positively impact the industrial sector.",

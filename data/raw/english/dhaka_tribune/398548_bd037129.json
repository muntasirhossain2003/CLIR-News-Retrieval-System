    "title": "Tauquir Ahmed reflects on early career in acting",
    "body": "Actor Tauquir Ahmed first entered mainstream acting through television dramas before moving on to films. He later transitioned to film direction. Recently, he reflected on the early days of his career and spoke about the remuneration he received at the time. He said that although his payment was significantly lower than what actors receive today, it was considered substantial for that period. Tauquir, who was then a student at Buet, continued his studies alongside acting. Despite various challenges, he maintained both commitments equally. In an interview with Maasranga Television, he mentioned that he initially earned Tk780 for each television drama, which was regarded as a considerable amount at the time. Addressing whether people truly need more money than what is necessary, he remarked that an excess of money can create difficulties. He explained that his personal financial struggles eventually eased as he began receiving regular payment from acting, completed his studies and gained recognition.",

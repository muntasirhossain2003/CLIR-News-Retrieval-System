The deceased was identified as Biru Molla (48), son of Abul Molla of Kamalpur village under Laxmikunda union. He was the convener of Laxmikunda union BNP and was known locally as an influential political figure. The incident occurred around 10:30am on December 17 at Kamalpur village. According to local residents and police, Biru Molla’s cousin Zahurul Molla had begun cutting soil from a disputed piece of family land on Monday, triggering tension between the two sides, reports our Pabna correspondent. In an attempt to resolve the dispute, Biru Molla went to Zahurul Molla’s house on Wednesday morning accompanied by several others. During discussions, an argument broke out between the two families. As the situation escalated, Zahurul Molla and his son allegedly fired blank shots to intimidate those present and asked them to leave. When the group refused to disperse, they reportedly opened fire directly. Biru Molla was shot in the head and died on the spot. Following the shooting, panic spread throughout the area. Police rushed to the scene after receiving information, recovered the body and sent it to a hospital for autopsy. Confirming the incident, Ishwardi Police Station Officer-in-Charge Mominuzzaman said the killing stemmed from a family land dispute. He added that legal action was underway against those involved.",

    "body": "The Indo-Pacific region is fast becoming a core area for global growth, security cooperation, and competition A teacher of international relations has flagged shortcomings in Bangladesh's Indo-Pacific Outlook (IPO) announced last year, seeking more “clarity, specificity, and comprehensiveness” of the document to reap benefits. “By doing so, Bangladesh can strengthen its position as an influential player in the Indo-Pacific landscape and ensure that its national interests are effectively represented amidst the evolving geopolitical dynamics,” Obaidul Haque, Associate Professor of Dhaka University, said on Tuesday. He said the Indo-Pacific region presents “both unprecedented opportunities and formidable challenges for Bangladesh. So, it is essential to critically assess its limitations and the challenges that may hinder its effectiveness.” He was speaking at a seminar styled “Indo Pacific Strategy (IPS) and Its Beyond: How to Consolidate Bilateral Relations Between Korea and Bangladesh” organized by the Embassy of South Korea. He highlighted the Korean government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and said key priorities of that document “resonates with Bangladesh's development goals”. Korean Ambassador Park Young-sik said a bilateral Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) could be the next “motor engine” to elevate the partnership to new heights in the next 50 years. The Indo-Pacific region, which includes over half the global population and links some of the world’s most rapidly expanding economies, is fast becoming a core area for global growth, security cooperation, and competition. “Our location at the apex of the Bay of Bengal gives us a critical stake in the Indo-Pacific, connecting us to key economies and vital sea lanes that fuel global trade,” Obaidul Haque said. “In today’s shifting geopolitical landscape, Bangladesh’s unique position is more relevant than ever,” he said. “The Indo-Pacific has become a stage where major powers, notably the US, China, and India, strive to influence the region’s future. These power dynamics not only impact regional stability but also pose complex choices for countries like Bangladesh.” The issues in the Indo-Pacific—ranging from maritime security and resource management to climate resilience—are challenges that Bangladesh cannot face alone. “Our engagement in this region, therefore, is not only a matter of seizing economic opportunities but also about building alliances that enhance resilience against shared risks,” he said. “While Bangladesh's IPO sets forth an ambitious vision for engagement in the region, it is essential to critically assess its limitations and the challenges that may hinder its effectiveness. “The IPO, while rooted in the principles of peace, cooperation, and inclusive development, exhibits several weaknesses that could impact its implementation and efficacy,” he said. One significant point of criticism revolves around the timing of the IPO's release. “Coinciding with the visit of the former Prime Minister (Sheikh Hasina) to three Western countries and the signing of an important deal with a major global financial institution for crucial development loans, the IPO's launch has raised suspicions among many,” he said, referring to her Japan, US and UK visit in April. “Critics argue that this timing suggests the document may have been hastily prepared as a strategic gesture to appease Western powers, potentially compromising Bangladesh's strategic autonomy.” He said the IPO lacks “concrete action plans and specific initiatives, making it appear more like a vision statement than a strategic roadmap.” “While the document outlines broad objectives, it does not provide specific timelines or benchmarks for achieving them. “This vagueness creates challenges for assessing progress and holding stakeholders accountable for implementing the outlined strategies. Without clear indicators of success, the effectiveness of the IPO may be called into question,” he said, adding that there had been “overemphasis on neutrality” “The IPO emphasizes Bangladesh's longstanding commitment to neutrality, which has been a cornerstone of its foreign policy. However, maintaining strict neutrality in a region characterized by intense strategic competition among major powers poses significant challenges,” he observed. “This stance may limit Bangladesh's ability to leverage strategic partnerships effectively, as it could be seen as indecisive or non-committal in situations requiring firm positions or alliances. “In an environment where nations are increasingly forming blocs based on shared interests, Bangladesh must navigate these dynamics carefully to avoid being sidelined.” The absence of security dimensions is also a point of criticism. “The IPO primarily focuses on economic cooperation and non-traditional security threats, such as climate change and terrorism, while largely overlooking traditional security challenges,” he said. “This oversight is particularly concerning given the persistent maritime disputes in the Bay of Bengal and the potential for regional conflicts that could arise from geopolitical tensions. By neglecting these critical issues, the IPO may leave Bangladesh ill-prepared to address the complexities of its security environment.” He said Bangladesh’s emphasis on maintaining good relations with all major powers, including India, China, and the United States, represents a “delicate” balancing act. “In a context where geopolitical competition is intensifying, this strategy can be challenging to sustain. Bangladesh must carefully calibrate its foreign policy to ensure it does not inadvertently align too closely with any one power, which could alienate others and undermine its diplomatic efforts.” With its advanced technology and robust economic presence, South Korea offers significant opportunities for Bangladesh to bolster its industrial and technological capacities. The Korean government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy emphasizes inclusive cooperation, infrastructure development, and sustainable economic growth—key priorities that resonate with Bangladesh's development goals. “Collaborative projects in areas such as information technology, renewable energy, and infrastructure can drive Bangladesh’s growth while strengthening bilateral ties,” Obaidul Haque said. “Furthermore, South Korea's participation in regional forums can help amplify Bangladesh's voice on issues of mutual concern, including climate change and maritime security.” Ambassador Park, however, said an EPA would be the next step forward in the bilateral relations. “A driving force behind our bilateral relations over the last fifty years was collaboration in the RMG sector. The bilateral EPA can be the next motor engine to elevate our partnership to new heights in the next fifty years,” he said, pushing for the start of the negotiation.",

    "body": "After nearly a month of preparations, public entry to the memorial area had remained completely restricted for the past four days in line with established practice People from all walks of life thronged the National Martyrs’ Memorial in Savar on Victory Day to pay tribute to the martyrs of the Liberation War, as the memorial was opened to the general public following the state ceremonies. After nearly a month of preparations, public entry to the memorial area had remained completely restricted for the past four days in line with established practice. The gates were opened on Tuesday for visitors after the president and the chief adviser of the interim government paid their respects. From the early hours before dawn, large crowds began gathering in the surrounding areas, eager to enter the memorial premises and lay wreaths in honour of the fallen heroes. On the ground, a steady stream of political activists, professionals, students, workers and ordinary citizens was seen along the Dhaka–Aricha Highway in front of the memorial. Many waited for four to five hours to get the opportunity to pay tribute. Faisal Mahmud, who travelled from the Mahishashi area of Sanora Union in Dhamrai, said he arrives every year before dawn to ensure early entry. “I entered only after the senior government officials had left. I will pay my respects at the altar and then return,” he said. Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies put in place a four-tier security system on the occasion of Victory Day. Alongside uniformed personnel, members of law enforcement in plain clothes were also deployed. Dhaka Range Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Rezaul Karim Mallick said that, in remembrance of those whose sacrifices brought an independent and sovereign Bangladesh, a four-tier security arrangement was strengthened at the National Martyrs’ Memorial for Victory Day. He added that more than 4,000 personnel were deployed from Aminbazar to the memorial, with enhanced traffic management and security measures in place. He said all necessary arrangements had been made to maintain peace and order, with security ensured across nearly 23 kilometres of highway through 13 sectors, involving police personnel both in uniform and plain clothes.",

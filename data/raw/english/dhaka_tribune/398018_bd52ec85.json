In a joint press release, the Primary Teachers’ Demand Implementation Council and the Primary Teachers’ Unity Council said: “The ongoing movement is aimed at realising the three-point demands of primary assistant teachers. Considering our moral responsibility, humanitarian grounds, and the welfare of tender-hearted students, we have decided to suspend the complete shutdown programme in all government primary schools from next Sunday until the examinations are completed. The third quarterly evaluation (annual examination) for all classes will begin on Sunday.”",

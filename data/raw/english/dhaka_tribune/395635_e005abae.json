    "body": "One key recommendation suggests relocating all primary flight training of the Bangladesh Air Force outside Dhaka to ensure public safety The investigation committee formed to look into the plane crash at Milestone School and College in Dhaka’s Uttara has submitted its report to the Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, concluding that the accident occurred after the pilot lost control during a training flight. Lieutenant General SM Kamrul Hasan, principal staff officer of the Armed Forces Division and head of the investigation committee, handed over the report to the chief adviser. Chief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam briefed the media at the Foreign Service Academy on Wednesday saying: “The report identifies the main cause of the accident. A technical fault caused the situation to slip beyond the pilot’s control during the training session.” The committee, formed following the crash of a training fighter jet on July 21, interviewed around 150 people, including experts and witnesses. It gathered 168 findings and made 33 recommendations. One key recommendation suggests relocating all primary flight training of the Bangladesh Air Force outside Dhaka to ensure public safety. The probe also revealed that the Milestone School building did not have approval under Rajuk’s building code. The structure had only one staircase instead of the required three, which the expert panel said could have reduced casualties if properly built. Among other recommendations, the committee proposed expanding existing runways in Barisal and Bogra and ensuring strict compliance with Rajuk’s building code in newly developed areas.",

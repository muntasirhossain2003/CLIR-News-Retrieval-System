    "body": "'Hasina, India’s proxy, carried out genocide against people of this country and killed innocent people in broad daylight,' a student says A group of students under an anti-imperialist banner burned an effigy of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, accusing him of “blatant interference” in Bangladesh’s Victory Day—achieved through the blood of millions of oppressed people—and of “desecrating” the occasion. The effigy burning took place at 4:45pm in front of the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (DUCSU) building. During the protest, students chanted slogans against Modi. One of the organizers, Riyad Zubah, said: “Ignoring people’s opinions, this beast from Gujarat—who tortures and oppresses minorities in India—was brought to Bangladesh by that monster’s open accomplices, and the people of Bangladesh spontaneously opposed it. Because of this opposition, that murderous accomplice Hasina, India’s proxy, carried out genocide against the people of this country and killed innocent people in broad daylight. India has been the enabler of the misrule that lasted 17 years in Bangladesh. Therefore, this is our protest against Indian hegemony in Bangladesh.” The students also placed a sticker of Modi near Madhur Canteen for people to trample on. Earlier, around 1pm, another group of students threw shoes at a photo of Golam Azam in front of DUCSU.",

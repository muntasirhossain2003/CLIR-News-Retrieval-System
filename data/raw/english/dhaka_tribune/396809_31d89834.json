Speaking at a networking and knowledge-sharing event, he said India remains a trusted and reliable partner for Bangladesh—especially in API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) sourcing, process technologies, and pharmaceutical machinery. The high commissioner emphasized that greater collaboration in this sector will not only boost industrial growth but also support affordable and accessible healthcare for millions across the region.
